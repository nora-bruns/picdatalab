Using the same national registry, clinical features and outcome of children hospitalized in Germany, and Innsbruck (Austria) were compared. Reported to the registry were 395 PIMS and 69 KD hospitalized patients. Patient age in PIMS cases was higher than in KD cases (median 7 [IQR 4-11] vs. 3 [IQR 1-4] years). A majority of both PIMS and KD patients were male and without comorbidities. PIMS patients more frequently presented with organ dysfunction, with the gastrointestinal (80%), cardiovascular (74%), and respiratory (52%) systems being most commonly affected. By contrast, KD patients more often displayed dermatological (99% vs. 68%) and mucosal changes (94% vs. 64%), plus cervical lymph node swelling (51% vs. 34%). Intensive care admission (48% vs. 19%), pulmonary support (32% vs. 10%), and use of inotropes/vasodilators (28% vs. 3%) were higher among PIMS cases. No patients died. Upon patient discharge, potentially irreversible sequelae-mainly cardiovascular-were reported (7% PIMS vs. 12% KD). Despite differences in age distribution and disease severity, PIMS and KD cases shared many common clinical and prognostic characteristics. This supports the hypothesis that the two entities represent a syndrome continuum.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'The Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Admissions (PIA) network aims to establish a nationwide database in Germany to gather epidemiological, clinical, and outcome data on pediatric critical illness. The heterogeneity of pediatric patients in intensive care units (PICU) poses challenges in obtaining sufficient case numbers for reliable research. Multicentered approaches, such as patient registries, have proven effective in collecting large-scale data. However, Germany lacks a systematic registration system for pediatric intensive care admissions, hindering epidemiological and outcome assessments. The PIA network intends to address these gaps and provide a framework for clinical and epidemiological research in pediatric intensive care. The network will interconnect PICUs across Germany and collect structured data on diagnoses, treatment, clinical course, and short-term outcomes. It aims to identify areas for improvement in care, enable disease surveillance, and potentially serve as a quality control tool. The PIA network builds upon the existing infrastructure of the German Pediatric Surveillance Unit ESPED and utilizes digitalized data collection techniques. Participating units will complete surveys on their organizational structure and equipment. The study population includes patients aged >/=28 days admitted to participating PICUs, with a more detailed survey for cases meeting specific criteria. Data will be collected by local PIA investigators, anonymized, and entered into a central database. The data protection protocol complies with regulations and ensures patient privacy. Quarterly data checks and customized quality reports will be conducted to monitor data completeness and plausibility. The network will evaluate its performance, data collection feasibility, and data quality. Eligible investigators can submit proposals for data analyses, which will be reviewed and analyzed by trained statisticians or epidemiologists. The PIA network aims to improve pediatric intensive care medicine in Germany by providing a comprehensive understanding of critical illness, benchmarking treatment quality, and enabling disease surveillance.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: A proportion of the convalescent SARS-CoV-2 pediatric population presents nonspecific symptoms, mental health problems, and a reduction in quality of life similar to myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and long COVID-19 symptomatic. However, data regarding its clinical manifestation and immune mechanisms are currently scarce. METHODS: In this study, we perform a comprehensive clinical and immunological profiling of 17 convalescent COVID-19 children with post-acute COVID-19 sequelae (PASC) manifestation and 13 convalescent children without PASC manifestation. A detailed medical history, blood and instrumental tests, and physical examination were obtained from all patients. SARS-CoV-2 reactive T-cell response was analyzed via multiparametric flow cytometry and the humoral immunity was addressed via pseudovirus neutralization and ELISA assay. RESULTS: The most common PASC symptoms were shortness of breath/exercise intolerance, paresthesia, smell/taste disturbance, chest pain, dyspnea, headache, and lack of concentration. Blood count and clinical chemistry showed no statistical differences among the study groups. We detected higher frequencies of spike (S) reactive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells among the PASC study group, characterized by TNFalpha and IFNgamma production and low functional avidity. CRP levels are positively correlated with IFNgamma producing reactive CD8(+) T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data might indicate a possible involvement of a persistent cellular inflammatory response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 in the development of the observed sequelae in pediatric PASC. These results may have implications on future therapeutic and prevention strategies.',\n",

This paper will discuss the latest knowledge of the common pediatric malignant FLLs, including undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, angiosarcoma, and malignant rhabdoid tumor. Medical imaging features are not only helpful for clinical diagnosis, but can also be useful in the evaluation and follow-up of pre- and post-treatment. The future perspectives of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) enhancement patterns of FLLs in pediatric patients are also mentioned.',\n",

       "               'AB': \"INTRODUCTION: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection. HPV is responsible for cancer of cervix uteri. Despite its safety and immunogenicity, HPV vaccine hesitancy is one of the most challenging topics that pediatricians face. METHODS: We aimed to describe the impact of knowledge, attitude, and practice towards vaccines in general, on practice related to HPV vaccination in Lebanon. A questionnaire addressed to parents of students (3-18 years of age) was distributed in 2 public and 2 private schools randomly selected from the greater Beirut area during the school year 2017-2018. Questionnaires covered knowledge, attitude, and practices of vaccination in general and HPV vaccine in particular. RESULTS: Out of 400 distributed questionnaires, 306 (76.5%) were returned. Of the 185 parents aware of HPV vaccine, 60% hadn't given or were not planning to give the HPV vaccine to their children. Of parents not in favor of HPV vaccine, 7.5 thought that vaccines aren't necessary versus none among those in favor of HPV vaccine(p = 0.02). Thirteen percent of those not in favor of HPV vaccine thought that vaccines are not safe versus 2.7% in the group in favor (p = 0.02). An effect of gender on vaccine acceptance was noted: mothers vs fathers and daughters vs sons. Lack of recommendation by pediatricians and the thought that too little is known about the vaccine were the most selected reasons for parents not wanting to vaccinate their children against HPV, whereas cost and religious and cultural beliefs seemed to have no impact. CONCLUSION: Most parents in our study did not vaccinate or weren't willing to vaccinate their children against HPV even when they were in favor of vaccines in general. Physician recommendation was shown to be one of the most important predictors of vaccination. Effort should be put into educating parents about the importance of the vaccine and its well-established safety and efficacy regardless of gender. Lebanese physicians should also be educated and empowered to recommend HPV vaccine more strongly and consistently.\",\n",

Due to the rarity, the understanding of these diseases is still very limited. In children, most malignant FLLs are congenital. It is very important to choose appropriate imaging examination concerning various factors. This paper will outline common pediatric malignant FLLs, including hepatoblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma and discuss them against the background of the latest knowledge on comparable/similar tumors in adults. Medical imaging features are of vital importance for the non-invasive diagnosis and follow-up of treatment of FLLs in pediatric patients. The use of CEUS in pediatric patients for characterizing those FLLs that remain indeterminate on conventional B mode ultrasounds may be an effective option in the future and has great potential to be integrated into imaging algorithms without the risk of exposure to ionizing radiation.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'Cross-reactive cellular and humoral immunity can substantially contribute to antiviral defense against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC). While the adult SARS-CoV-2 cellular and humoral immunity and its cross-recognition potential against VOC is broadly analyzed, similar data regarding the pediatric population are missing. In this study, we perform an analysis of the humoral and cellular SARS-CoV-2 response immune of 32 convalescent COVID-19 children (children), 27 convalescent vaccinated adults(C + V+) and 7 unvaccinated convalescent adults (C + V-). Similarly to adults, a significant reduction of cross-reactive neutralizing capacity against delta and omicron VOC was observed 6 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. While SAR-CoV-2 neutralizing capacity was comparable among children and C + V- against all VOC, children demonstrated as expected an inferior humoral response when compared to C + V+. Nevertheless, children generated SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells with broad cross-recognition potential. When compared to V + C+, children presented even comparable frequencies of WT-reactive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells with high avidity and functionality. Taking into consideration the limitations of study - unknown disease onset for 53% of the asymptomatic pediatric subjects, serological detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection-, our results suggest that following SARS-CoV-2 infection children generate a humoral SARS-CoV-2 response with neutralizing potential comparable to unvaccinated COVID-19 convalescent adults as well a sustained SARS-CoV-2 cellular response cross-reactive to VOC.',\n",

       "               'AB': \"Premature birth imposes considerable challenges on the preterm infant, but also challenges the mother, who may not yet be prepared for motherhood and encounter psychological stress during the post-partum period. This secondary analysis of a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to investigate how mothers perceive their preterm infants. We surveyed 33 mothers of preterm infants born before 32  weeks of gestation, who were participating in an RCT on music therapy. We employed the neonatal perception inventory (NPI), an instrument designed to assess the mother's perception and expectations regarding her infant immediately after birth. Infants were randomly assigned to either standard care (control group) or standard care plus music therapy (intervention group). Eighteen mothers from the intervention group participated in the survey (mean age 34.1  +/-  4.6 years) and 15 mothers from the control group (mean age 29.6  +/-  4.2  years). At the time of the infant's hospital discharge, mothers rated their expectations of how they felt a baby should behave (NPI I) and how they perceived their own infant (NPI II). The NPI score difference was calculated by subtracting the NPI II from the NPI I. Mean NPI I scores were comparable between both groups, but NPI II scores in the intervention group were better [18.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 16.6-19.4] than in the control group (19.1, 95% CI 18.0-20.3). The relative probability of mothers rating their own baby as better than average was 1.94 (95% CI 1.00-3.79) for mothers whose infants received music therapy. These findings suggest that music therapy in the neonatal intensive care unit can positively influence mothers' perception of their hospitalized preterm infant.\",\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Identifying phenotypes in sepsis patients may enable precision medicine approaches. However, the generalisability of these phenotypes to specific patient populations is unclear. Given that paediatric cancer patients with sepsis have different host response and pathogen profiles and higher mortality rates when compared to non-cancer patients, we determined whether unique, reproducible, and clinically-relevant sepsis phenotypes exist in this specific patient population. METHODS: We studied patients with underlying malignancies admitted with sepsis to one of 25 paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) participating in two large, multi-centre, observational cohorts from the European SCOTER study (n = 383 patients; study period between January 1, 2018 and January 1, 2020) and the U.S. Novel Data-Driven Sepsis Phenotypes in Children study (n = 1898 patients; study period between January 1, 2012 and January 1, 2018). We independently used latent class analysis (LCA) in both cohorts to identify phenotypes using demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from the first 24 h of PICU admission. We then tested the association of the phenotypes with clinical outcomes in both cohorts. FINDINGS: LCA identified two distinct phenotypes that were comparable across both cohorts. Phenotype 1 was characterised by lower serum bicarbonate and albumin, markedly increased lactate and hepatic, renal, and coagulation abnormalities when compared to phenotype 2. Patients with phenotype 1 had a higher 90-day mortality (European cohort 29.2% versus 13.4%, U.S. cohort 27.3% versus 11.4%, p < 0.001) and received more vasopressor and renal replacement therapy than patients with phenotype 2. After adjusting for severity of organ dysfunction, haematological cancer, prior stem cell transplantation and age, phenotype 1 was associated with an adjusted OR of death at 90-day of 1.9 (1.04-3.34) in the European cohort and 1.6 (1.2-2.2) in the U.S. cohort. INTERPRETATION: We identified two clinically-relevant sepsis phenotypes in paediatric cancer patients that are reproducible across two international, multicentre cohorts with prognostic implications. These results may guide further research regarding therapeutic approaches for these specific phenotypes.

METHODS: Critical analysis of available studies and recent meta-analyses, and discussion of the practical consequences in the FN working group of the German Societies for Paediatric Oncology and Haematology and Paediatric Infectious Diseases. RESULTS: The available evidence does not support a clinically significant outcome benefit of a TTA<60 min in all paediatric patients with FN. Studies suggesting such a benefit are biased (mainly triage bias), use different TTA definitions and display further methodical limitations. In any case, a TTA<60 min remains an essential component of the 1st hour-bundle in paediatric cancer patients with septic shock or sepsis with organ dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Provided that all paediatric FN patients receive a structured medical history and physical examination (including vital signs) by experienced and trained medical personnel in a timely fashion, and provided that a sepsis triage and management bundle is established and implemented, a TTA lower than 3 hours is sufficient and reasonable in stable paediatric cancer patients with FN.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'AIM: Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a major morbidity in preterm infants causing visual impairment including blindness. Prevention and timely treatment are critical. We investigated the potential role of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions as risk factor for ROP development. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of data from 68 tertiary level neonatal intensive care units in Germany. Preterm infants born at 22 + 0 to 28 + 6 weeks of gestation between January 2009 and December 2021 were enrolled. RESULTS: We included n = 12 565 infants. Prevalence of any ROP was 49.2% with most infants being diagnosed with stage 1 (21.5%) and 2 disease (17.2%). ROP stage 3 was present in 10.2%, stage 4 in 0.3%, and ROP requiring treatment in 6.6%. Infants with ROP had significantly more frequently a history of RBC transfusions. Adjusting for confounders, RBC transfusions were associated with increased odds of ROP (OR 1.4, p < 0.001), ROP progression (OR 2.1, p < 0.01) and ROP requiring treatment (OR 3.6, p < 0.001). Restrictive transfusion approaches correlated with decreased (OR 0.7, p < 0.001), liberal regimes with increased odds (OR 1.2, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The present study confirmed an association of RBC transfusions and ROP. Our findings emphasise the need for anaemia prevention and critical re-evaluation of transfusion practices in preterm infants.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate and compare the outcome of conservatively or surgically treated children with cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) and new-onset CCM-related epilepsy (CRE) during a 5-year period. METHODS: In this observational monocentric cohort study, data were collected ambispectivley. Our database was screened for CCM patients treated between 2003 and 2020. Patients </=18 years of age with complete magnetic resonance imaging dataset, clinical baseline characteristics, and diagnosis of new-onset CRE were included. Definite seizure control was classified as International League Against Epilepsy class <2. Functional outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale score. CRE patients were separated into two groups according to their treatment modality. Seizure control, intake of antiseizure medication, and functional outcomes were assessed. Systematic literature research was performed to identify other cases of new-onset CRE in children and to compare the collected data with published data. RESULTS: Thirty-nine pediatric CRE patients were analyzed. A total of 18 (46.1%) patients were conservatively treated, while 21 (53.8%) underwent surgical CCM removal. While the functional outcome was similar in both groups at the last follow-up, definite seizure control was better in the surgical group (77.8%) than in the conservative group (25.0%) both after 5-years of follow-up (p = 0.038), and at last follow-up with 85.7% versus 50% respectively (p = 0.035). We found substantially higher rates of discontinuation of antiseizure medication at the last available follow-up in patients undergoing surgical resection (p = 0.009). The systematic literature review identified 4 studies with a total of 30 additional children with early onset CRE. CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment of pediatric patients with new-onset CRE had higher rates of complete seizure control and early discontinuation of antiseizure medication than conservative treatment. Neurological outcomes of patients managed surgically or conservatively were comparable. These results encourage early surgical management of children with CRE even in the absence of pharmacoresistant epilepsy, but randomized control trials are urgently needed for further decision-making.',\n",

Subsequent organ failure and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) account for 25% of all early postnatal deaths. The neonatal sequential organ failure assessment (nSOFA) considers platelet count and respiratory and cardiovascular dysfunction in neonates with sepsis. To evaluate whether nSOFA is also a useful predictor for in-hospital mortality in neonates (>/=36 + 0 weeks of gestation (GA)) following asphyxia with HIE and therapeutic hypothermia (TH), (2) nSOFA was documented at </=6 h of life. (3) A total of 65 infants fulfilled inclusion criteria for TH. All but one infant received cardiopulmonary resuscitation and/or respiratory support at birth. nSOFA was lower in survivors (median 0 [IQR 0-2]; n = 56, median GA 39 + 3, female n = 28 (50%)) than in non-survivors (median 10 [4-12], p < 0.001; n = 9, median GA 38 + 6, n = 4 (44.4%)). This was also observed for the respiratory (p < 0.001), cardiovascular (p < 0.001), and hematologic sub-scores (p = 0.003). The odds ratio for mortality was 1.6 [95% CI = 1.2-2.1] per one-point increase in nSOFA. The optimal cut-off value of nSOFA to predict mortality was 3.5 (sensitivity 100.0%, specificity 83.9%). (4) Since early accurate prognosis following asphyxia with HIE and TH is essential to guide decision making, nSOFA (</=6 h of life) offers the possibility of identifying infants at risk of mortality.',\n",

This study aimed to develop a straightforward objective Ultrasound Score of Brain Development to assess cortical development in preterm infants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 344 serial ultrasound examinations from 94 preterm infants born at </= 32 weeks of gestation were analyzed to identify brain structures suitable for a scoring system. RESULTS: Among 11 candidate structures, 3 cerebral landmarks were selected due to their correlation with gestational age: the interopercular opening (P < .001), the height of the insular cortex (P < .001), and the depth of the cingulate sulcus (P < .001). These structures can be easily visualized in a single midcoronal view in the plane through the third ventricle and the foramina of Monro. A score point from 0 to 2 was assigned to each measurement, culminating in a total score ranging from 0 to 6. The Ultrasound Score of Brain Development correlated significantly with gestational age (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed Ultrasound Score of Brain Development has the potential for application as an objective indicator of brain maturation in correlation with gestational age, circumventing the need to rely on individual growth trajectories and percentiles for each specific structure.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vein of Galen malformation is a rare congenital cerebrovascular malformation. In affected patients, increased cerebral venous pressure constitutes an important etiologic factor for the development of brain parenchymal damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of serial cerebral venous Doppler measurements to detect and monitor increased cerebral venous pressure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective monocentric analysis of ultrasound examinations within the first 9 months of life in patients with vein of Galen malformation admitted at <28 days of life. Categorization of perfusion waveforms in the superficial cerebral sinus and veins into 6 patterns was based on antero- and retrograde flow components. We performed an analysis of flow profiles across time and correlation with disease severity, clinical interventions, and congestion damage on cerebral MR imaging. RESULTS: The study included 44 Doppler ultrasound examinations of the superior sagittal sinus and 36 examinations of the cortical veins from 7 patients. Doppler flow profiles before interventional therapy correlated with disease severity determined by the Bicetre Neonatal Evaluation Score (Spearman rho = -0.97, P = < .001). At this time, 4 of 7 patients (57.1%) showed a retrograde flow component in the superior sagittal sinus, whereas after embolization, none of the 6 treated patients presented with a retrograde flow component. Only patients with a high retrograde flow component (equal or more than one-third retrograde flow, n = 2) showed severe venous congestion damage on cerebral MR imaging. CONCLUSIONS: Flow profiles in the superficial cerebral sinus and veins appear to be a useful tool to noninvasively detect and monitor cerebral venous congestion in vein of Galen malformation.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Giant cavernous malformations (GCMs) are rare and poorly characterized neurovascular lesions in adults or children and often misclassified. In this study, we provide a review of pediatric GCM cases to highlight this rare entity as an important differential diagnosis in preoperative assessment. METHODS: We report a pediatric case of GCM that presented as an intracerebral, periventricular, and infiltrative mass lesion. We performed a systematic review of published literature describing cases of GCM in children using the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. Studies describing cerebral or spinal cavernous malformation >4 cm were included. Demographic, clinical, radiographic, and outcome data were extracted. RESULTS: Thirty-eight studies accounting for 61 patients were reviewed. most patients were 1-10 years old and 55.73% were male. Average lesion sizes ranged between 4 and 6 cm (40.98% >6 cm; 8.19% >10 cm). Supratentorial localization was most common (75.40%), with frontal and parieto-occipital regions being frequent localizations. Infratentorial lesions (24.60%) were located within the cerebellum (16.39%) and brainstem (8.19%). One case of spinal cavernoma was found. The main clinical manifestations were seizures (44.26%), focal neurologic deficit (36.06%), and headache (22.95%). Imaging showed contrast enhancement (36.06%), cystic features (27.86%), and infiltrative growth pattern (4.91%). CONCLUSIONS: GCMs show variable clinical and radiologic features, representing a diagnostic challenge for treating surgeons. Imaging may show various tumorlike features such as cystic or infiltrative patterns with contrast enhancement. The existence of GCM should be considered preoperatively. Gross total resection should be attempted whenever possible, because it correlates with a good recovery and long-term outcomes. Also, a clear definition criteria of when a cerebral cavernous malformation is termed giant should be established.',\n",

The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of differential diagnoses in suspected pediatric LC patients and assess whether adult LC symptom clusters are applicable to pediatric patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pediatric presentations at the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Department of the University Hospital Essen (Germany) were assessed retrospectively. The correlation of initial symptoms and final diagnoses (LC versus other diseases or unclarified) was assessed. The sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values of adult LC symptom clusters were calculated. RESULTS: Of 110 patients, 32 (29%) suffered from LC, 52 (47%) were diagnosed with alternative somatic/mental diseases, and 26 (23%) remained unclarified. Combined neurological and respiratory clusters displayed a sensitivity of 0.97 (95% CI 0.91-1.00) and a negative predictive value of 0.97 (0.92-1.00) for LC. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of alternative somatic and mental diseases in pediatric patients with suspected LC is high. The range of underlying diseases is wide, including chronic and potentially life-threatening conditions. Neurological and respiratory symptom clusters may help to identify patients that are unlikely to be suffering from LC.',\n",

Evidence and recommendations regarding the most effective antimicrobial strategy are lacking. (2) Results: Of 39 pLTX centres, 20 responded. Aminopenicillins plus ss-lactamase inhibitors were used by six (30%) and third generation cephalosporins by three (15%), with the remaining centres reporting heterogenous regimens. Broad-spectrum regimens were the standard in 10 (50%) of centres and less frequent in the 16 (80%) centres with an infectious disease specialist. The duration ranged mainly between 24-48 h and 3-5 days in the absence and 3-5 days or 6-10 days in the presence of risk factors. Strategies regarding antifungal, antiviral, adjunctive antimicrobial, and surveillance strategies varied widely. (3) Methods: This international multicentre survey endorsed by the European Liver Transplant Registry queried all European pLTX centres from the registry on their current practice of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis and antimicrobial strategies via an online questionnaire. (4) Conclusions: This survey found great heterogeneity regarding all aspects of postoperative antimicrobial treatment, surveillance, and prevention of infections in European pLTX centres. Evidence-based recommendations are urgently needed to optimise antimicrobial strategies and reduce the spectrum and duration of antimicrobial exposure.',\n",

METHODS: We included patients aged </=18 years with complete baseline characteristics, a magnetic resonance imaging dataset, >/=1 CCM-related ICH and >/=1 follow-up examination, who were treated between 2003 and 2021. Neurological functional status was obtained using modified Rankin Scale scores at diagnosis, before and after each ICH, and at last follow-up. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to determine the cumulative 1-year risk of third ICH. RESULTS: A total of 55 pediatric patients (median [interquartile range] age 12 [11] years) were analyzed. Univariate analysis identified brainstem cavernous malformation (BSCM; p = 0.019) as a statistically significant predictor for unfavorable outcome after second ICH. Outcome after second ICH was significantly worse in 12 patients (42.9%; p = 0.030) than after first ICH and in five patients (55.6%; p = 0.038) after a third ICH compared to a second ICH. Cumulative 12-month risk of rebleeding during the first year after a second ICH was 10.7% (95% confidence interval 2.8%-29.37%). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with a BSCM have a higher risk of worse outcome after second ICH. Functional outcome improves over time after an ICH but worsens following each ICH compared to baseline or previous ICH. Second bleed was associated with neurological deterioration compared to initial ICH, and this deteriorated further after a third ICH.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'B cell maturation and immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoire selection are governed by expression of a functional B cell receptor (BCR). Naive B cells co-express their BCR as IgM and IgD isotype. However, the role of the additionally expressed IgD on naive B cells is not known. Here we assessed the impact of IgD on naive B cell maturation and Ig repertoire selection in 8 individuals from 3 different families with heterozygous loss-of-function or loss-of expression mutations in IGHD. Although naive B cells from these individuals expressed IgM on their surface, the IGHD variant in heterozygous state entailed a chimeric situation by allelic exclusion with almost half of the naive B cell population lacking surface IgD expression. Flow cytometric analyses revealed a distinct phenotype of IgD-negative naive B cells with decreased expression of CD19, CD20 and CD21 as well as lower BAFF-R and integrin-beta7 expression. IgD-negative B cells were less responsive in vitro after engaging the IgM-BCR, TLR7/9 or CD40 pathway. Additionally, a selective disadvantage of IgD-negative B cells within the T2 transitional and mature naive B cell compartment as well as reduced frequencies of IgM(lo/-) B cells within the mature naive B cell compartment lacking IgD were evident. RNA-Ig-seq of bulk sorted B cell populations showed an altered selection of distinct V(H) segments in the IgD-negative mature naive B cell population. We conclude that IgD expression on human naive B cells is redundant for generation of naive B cells in general, but further shapes the naive B cell compartment starting from T2 transitional B cells. Our observations suggest an unexpected role of IgD expression to be critical for selection of distinct Ig V(H) segments into the pre-immune Ig repertoire and for the survival of IgM(lo/-) naive B cells known to be enriched in poly-/autoreactive B cell clones.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'The purpose of this study was to investigate the functional outcome following surgical resection of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) in pediatric patients. We screened our institutional database of CCM patients treated between 2003 and 2021. Inclusion regarded individuals younger or equal than 18 years of age with complete clinical baseline characteristics, magnetic resonance imaging dataset, and postoperative follow-up time of at least three months. Functional outcome was quantified using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score and assessed at admission, discharge, and last follow-up examination. The primary endpoint was the postoperative functional outcome. As a secondary endpoint, predictors of postoperative functional deterioration were assessed. A total of 49 pediatric patients with a mean age of 11.3 +/- 5.7 years were included for subsequent analyses. Twenty individuals (40.8%) were female. Complete resection of the lesion was achieved in 44 patients (89.8%), and two patients with incomplete resection were referred for successive remnant removal. The mean follow-up time after surgery was 44 months (IQR: 13 - 131). The mean mRS score was 1.6 on admission, 1.7 at discharge, and 0.9 at the latest follow-up. Logistic regression analysis adjusted to age and sex identified brainstem localization (aOR = 53.45 [95%CI = 2.26 - 1261.81], p = .014) as a predictor of postoperative deterioration. This study indicates that CCM removal in children can be regarded as safe and favorable for the majority of patients, depending on lesion localization. Brainstem localization implies a high risk of postoperative morbidity and indication for surgery should be balanced carefully. Minor evidence indicates that second-look surgery for CCM remnants might be safe and favorable.',\n",

Because ultrasound artifacts are predominantly used in pulmonary sonography to assess pathologic processes, the variability of sonographically imageable phenomena is limited. For this reason, different pulmonary diseases may present very similarly in ultrasound. Therefore, a correct interpretation of the findings is only possible in the clinical context, taking into account the age-dependent differential diagnoses.The particular relevance of lung ultrasound in the treatment of neonatal patients results from a close correlation between the extent of sonographically-depictable pathologies and parameters of respiratory insufficiency. This suggests a direct correlation between ultrasound findings and the severity of lung injury. Lung ultrasound thus represents a unique, ubiquitously available, bedside, serial method for monitoring the pulmonary status.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'Pediatric neurocritical care requires multidisciplinary expertise for the care of critically ill children. Approximately 14-16% of critically ill children in pediatric intensive care suffer from a primary neurological disease, whereby cardiac arrest and severe traumatic brain injury play major roles in Europe. The short-term goal of interventions in the pediatric intensive care unit is to stabilize vital functions, whereas the overarching goal is to achieve survival without neurological damage that enables fulfillment of the individual developmental physiological potential. For this reason, evidence-based methods for brain monitoring during the acute phase and recovery are necessary, which can be performed clinically or with technical devices. This applies to critically ill children with primary neurological diseases and for all children at risk for secondary neurological insults. Patients with diseases of the peripheral nervous system are also treated in pediatric intensive care medicine. In these patients, the primary aim frequently consists of bridging the time until recovery after acute deterioration, for example during an infection. In these patients, monitoring the cerebral function can be especially challenging, because due to the underlying disease the results of the examination cannot be interpreted in the same way as for previously neurologically healthy children. This article summarizes the complexity of pediatric neurocritical care by presenting examples of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in the context of various neurological diseases that can be routinely encountered in the pediatric intensive care unit and can only be successfully treated by multidisciplinary teams.',\n",

       "               'AB': \"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, parents of infants born very preterm or at risk were exceptionally worried about being infected. The only means of protection during the onset of the pandemic was social distancing. Video consultations for neurodevelopmental follow-up care were offered as an alternative way to stay in contact with patients and their families, to provide expert support, and to monitor and assess children's development. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of and family satisfaction with video consultations, interviews were conducted after video and in-person consultations. METHODS: An interview with 28 questions was created to evaluate parental satisfaction with the consultations (eg, their confidentiality and the children's behavior). A total of 93 interviews with parents were conducted between March 2020 and February 2021 and compared (58 after video consultations and 35 after in-person consultations). The interviews were conducted at the end of the consultations by a trained professional. The video consultations were conducted using a certified platform created by Zava Sprechstunde Online, maintaining data protection with end-to-end encryption. Follow-up consultations (video or in-person) were performed at corrected ages of 3, 6, and 12 months as well as 2, 3, 4, and 5 years. The rate of total follow-up appointments attended during the survey period was evaluated and compared with the previous year. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the video and in-person consultation groups in satisfaction, attitudes on the confidentiality of the consultation, or discussion of private and sensitive information. Following video consultations, parents were significantly more likely to report that they were avoiding contact with medical professionals during the pandemic (P=.045; Shapiro-Wilk W=1094.5, Cohen d=-0.1782146) than the in-person consultation group. Parents in the video-consultation group stated that performing a guided examination on their child was comfortable and helped them understand their child's development. In fact, they agreed to take advantage of future video consultations. The rate of total follow-up appointments increased compared to the previous year. Between March 2019 and February 2020, 782 of 984 (79.5%) children born at Essen University Hospital attended a follow-up appointment. During the survey period, between March 2020 and February 2021, a total of 788 of 1086 children (73%) attended a follow-up appointment, of which 117 (14.9%) were video consultations. CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility of attending video consultations for follow-up care of very preterm or at-risk infants and parental satisfaction with these consultations were as high as for in-person consultations. Parents rated video consultations as being as confidential as in-person appointments. Telemedicine can be offered as an equivalent alternative to in-person consultations and is particularly useful under certain circumstances, such as for very sick children who require assistive devices or respiratory support and oxygen or for those living a long distance away.\",\n",

       "               'AB': 'Diseases of the respiratory system are among the main problems of premature patients in the neonatal intensive care unit. Radiography of the thorax is the gold standard of imaging. This results in high cumulative radiation exposure with potential negative long-term consequences. Ultrasound examination of thoracic structures represents a promising radiation-free and ubiquitously available alternative.A healthy, ventilated lung can only be imaged via artifacts, since total reflection of the sound waves occurs due to the high impedance difference between tissue and air-filled lung. Pathologies of pleura and subpleural lung tissue lead to changes in the acoustic properties of the tissue and thus to variations in the artifacts that can be imaged. The main sonographic characteristics of pulmonary pathology are: pleural line abnormalities, increased B-lines and comet-tail artifacts, lung consolidations, a visible pulmonary pulse, pleural sliding abnormalities, and visualization of effusions. Deviations from normal sonographic findings can be assigned to specific underlying pathophysiologies, so that conclusions about the disease can be drawn in conjunction with the clinical symptoms.',\n",

Design: We retrospectively analyzed non-neonates who were treated in our PICU and received amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG). Patients: 27 patients aged between 29 days and 10 0/12 years (median 7.3 months) were included, who received a total of 35 aEEGS. Measurements: aEEG tracings were assessed for background (BG) pattern and its evolution, seizures, and side differences using a visual classification (Hellstrom-Westas). Clinical data were collected from patients' histories and analyzed for correlation with aEEG findings. Main results: While rare in early years, there was an increase in use over time. Most aEEGs were conducted because of (suspected) seizures or for management of antiepileptic treatment. aEEG had low sensitivity but high specificity for recognition of pathological BG pattern with reference to conventional EEG. Worsening of BG pattern or failure to improve was associated with death. Seizure detection rates by aEEG were higher than by clinical observation, especially for identification of non-convulsive epileptic state (ES). Side differences in aEEG were rare, but if present, they were associated with unilateral brain injury. Conclusions: aEEG is useful for the detection of seizures and ES in pediatric intensive care patients. Abnormal BG pattern and poor evolution of BG are negatively associated with survival. aEEG is a potential supplement to conventional EEG, facilitating long-term surveillance of cerebral function when continuous full-channel EEG is not available. Further investigation is needed.\",\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Outcomes for children diagnosed with cancer have improved dramatically over the past 20 years. However, although 40% of pediatric cancer patients require at least one intensive care admission throughout their disease course, PICU outcomes and resource utilization by this population have not been rigorously studied in this specific group. METHODS: Using a systematic strategy, we searched Medline, Embase, and CINAHL databases for articles describing PICU mortality of pediatric cancer patients admitted to PICU. Two investigators independently applied eligibility criteria, assessed data quality, and extracted data. We pooled PICU mortality estimates using random-effects models and examined mortality trends over time using meta-regression models. RESULTS: Out of 1218 identified manuscripts, 31 studies were included covering 16,853 PICU admissions with the majority being retrospective in nature. Overall pooled weighted mortality was 27.8% (95% confidence interval (CI), 23.7-31.9%). Mortality decreased slightly over time when post-operative patients were excluded. The use of mechanical ventilation (odds ratio (OR): 18.49 [95% CI 13.79-24.78], p\\u202f<\\u202f0.001), inotropic support (OR: 14.05 [95% CI 9.16-21.57], p\\u202f<\\u202f0.001), or continuous renal replacement therapy (OR: 3.24 [95% CI 1.31-8.04], p\\u202f=\\u202f0.01) was significantly associated with PICU mortality. CONCLUSIONS: PICU mortality rates of pediatric cancer patients are far higher when compared to current mortality rates of the general PICU population. PICU mortality has remained relatively unchanged over the past decades, a slight decrease was only seen when post-operative patients were excluded. This compared infavorably with the improved mortality seen in adults with cancer admitted to ICU, where research-led improvements have led to the paradigm of unlimited, aggressive ICU management without any limitations on resuscitations status, for a time-limited trial.',\n",

       "               'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Value assessment of vaccination programs against serogroup B invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is on the agenda of public health authorities. Current evidence on the burden due to IMD is unfit for pinning down the nature and magnitude of the full social and economic costs of IMD for two reasons. First, the concepts and components that need to be studied are not agreed, and second, measures of the concepts that have been studied are weak and inconsistent. Thus, the economic evaluation of the available serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) vaccines is difficult. The aims of this DELPHI study are to: (1) agree on the concepts and components determining the burden of MenB diseases that need to be studied; and (2) seek consensus on appropriate methods and study designs to measure quality of life (QoL) associated with MenB induced long-term sequelae in future studies. METHODS: We designed a DELPHI questionnaire based on the findings of a recent systematic review on the QoL associated with IMD-induced long-term sequelae, and iteratively interviewed a panel of international experts, including physicians, health economists, and patient representatives. Experts were provided with a controlled feedback based on the results of the previous round. RESULTS: Experts reached consensus on all questions after two DELPHI rounds. Major gaps in the literature relate (i) to the classification of sequelae, which allows differentiation of severity levels, (ii) to the choice of QoL measures, and (iii) to appropriate data sources to examine long-term changes and deficits in patients' QoL. CONCLUSIONS: Better conceptualisation of the structure of IMD-specific sequelae and of how their diverse forms of severity might impact the QoL of survivors of IMD as well as their family network and care-providers is needed to generate relevant, reliable and generalisable data on QoL in the future. The results of this DELPHI panel provide useful guidance on how to choose the study design, target population and appropriate QoL measures for future research and hence, help promote the appropriateness and consistency in study methodology and sample characteristics.\",\n",

It is unknown whether watching a video in the intervention room has a similar effect, and therefore is able to reduce sedative doses in children undergoing small medical procedures. Aim of this prospective study was to determine the effect of watching a standardized cartoon immediately before and during sleep induction for deep sedation on consumption of propofol in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 50 children aged 2-14 years undergoing deep sedation were randomly assigned to 2 groups: (A) watching or (B) not watching a standardized videoclip during sleep induction with propofol. The achievement of predefined sedation depth was objectified by measuring Comfort Score (aim 10-14) and Bispectral Index (aim 50-60). RESULTS: The median sleep induction dose of propofol did not differ in both groups (A: 1.76 (0.62-4.37) mg/kg; B: 1.37 (0.66-5.26) mg/kgKG; p=0.65). Cartoon watching was associated with shorter sleep onset latency (A: 120 (60-480)s; B: 240 (40-600)s; p=0.043). Subgroup analysis reveals this especially for school children and girls. In both groups no complications occurred. CONCLUSION: Children watching a standard cartoon during sleep induction for deep sedation have a shorter sleep onset time but sedative dose is not reduced.',\n",

Plasmodium malariae, the least prevalent of the five Plasmodium species that cause human malaria, has unique characteristics including prolonged prepatent periods and life-long persistance. In non-endemic countries and particular in neonates with coexisting diseases diagnosis and therapy pose challenges. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a rare case of severe congenital P. malariae malaria in a 2-month-old female infant born in Germany to a Nigerian mother. The infant presented with fever, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, and respiratory distress. Initial workup revealed significant haemolysis, hepatopathy, and thrombocytopenia. Microscopic and PCR confirmed P. malariae. Shortly after the initial presentation, the infant developed clinical signs of cerebral malaria and organ failure, requiring invasive ventilation, anti-seizure medication, and vasoactive support. Following treatment with intravenous artesunate and oral atovaquone/proguanil, the infant showed significant improvement and was discharged after 36 days (22 days of paediatric intensive care) with a multidisciplinary follow-up plan. At six months post-discharge, she demonstrated stable organ function and mild developmental delay. CONCLUSION: The case highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic complexities of life-threatening congenital P. malariae infections in non-endemic countries. It underlines the importance of clinicians' awareness of maternal travel or migration history and individualized treatment strategies. The increasing global mobility necessitates updated guidelines for congenital malaria management even for less likely P. malariae infections. Prophylactic measures, early recognition, and multidisciplinary management are critical for improving outcomes for such rare but severe presentations and their long-lasting complications. Possible comprehensive neonatal malaria screening in high-risk populations should be considered in the future.\",\n",

       "               'AB': 'OBJECTIVES: The Pediatric Sepsis Definition Task Force developed and validated a new organ dysfunction score, the Phoenix Sepsis Score (PSS), as a predictor of mortality in children with suspected or confirmed infection. The PSS showed improved performance compared with prior scores. However, the criteria were derived in a general pediatric population, in which only 10% had cancer. Given that pediatric cancer patients with sepsis have higher mortality compared with noncancer patients with sepsis, we aimed to assess the PSS in PICU patients with cancer and sepsis. DESIGN: Retrospective multicenter cohort study. SETTING: Twelve PICUs across Europe. PATIENTS: Each PICU identified patients 18 years young or younger, with underlying malignancy and suspected or proven sepsis, and admission between January 1, 2018, and January 1, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The PSS and three other scores, including Phoenix-8, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 (PELOD-2) score, and pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA) score, were calculated for comparison. The primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. We compared score performance using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) analyses. Among 383 patients with proven or suspected sepsis, 90-day mortality was 19.3% (74/383). We failed to identify an association between a particular score and performance for 90-day mortality. The mean (95% CI) values for the AUROC of each score was: PSS 0.66 (0.59-0.72), Phoenix-8 0.65 (0.58-0.72), PELOD-2 0.64 (0.57-0.71), and pSOFA 0.67 (0.60-0.74) and for the AUPRC of each score: PSS 0.32 (0.23-0.42), Phoenix-8 0.32 (0.23-0.42), PELOD-2 0.32 (0.22-0.43), and pSOFA 0.36 (0.26-0.46). Similar results were obtained for PICU mortality or sepsis-related PICU mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to the general PICU population, our retrospective test of the PSS in a PICU oncology dataset with suspected or proved sepsis from European PICUs, 2018-2020, failed to identify improved performance in association with mortality. This unique patient population deserves development of organ dysfunction scores that reflect organ dysfunction and mortality data specifically from these patients and will require prospective validation in future studies.',\n",

However, this vascular neogenesis takes place at a microscopic scale that cannot be observed with current clinical imaging techniques. Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) allows us to observe micro-vessels of the order of a few microns at depths of several centimeters. This can be done using conventional clinical ultrasound scanners and contrast sequences (CEUS). In this study, ULM is used to observe the human microvasculature in neonatal patients undergoing treatment for life-threatening malformations forming direct connections between the cerebral arterial and venous systems. It is observed that neuroendovascular treatment of neonatal arteriovenous malformations causes remodeling and reorganization of the cerebral vasculature by also activating corticomedullary vascular connections. ULM enables us to follow microvascular changes in human neonates with high spatio-temporal resolution. ULM may provide a novel clinical translatable tool, particularly including cerebral imaging in very young patients.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'OBJECTIVES: The performance of injury severity scores (ISSs), used widely to quantify injury severity and predict outcomes, has not been investigated in German pediatric cases. This study aims to identify the most feasible and accurate injury score predictor of mortality in German children with trauma using International Classification of Diseases 10 (ICD-10). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Between 2014 and 2020, a retrospective observational cohort study of hospital admissions cases aged <18 years with injury-related ICD-10 codes, using the German hospital database (GHD), was conducted. The maximum abbreviated injury scale and ISS were calculated using the International Classification of Diseases-Abbreviated Injury Scale (ICD-AIS) map provided by the Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine, adjusted to the German modification of the ICD-10 classification. The survival risk ratio was used to calculate the single-worst ICD-derived injury (single International Classification of Disease Injury Severity Score [ICISS]) and a multiplicative ICISS. Logistic regressions were conducted for each of the four above-mentioned scores (predictors) to predict in-hospital mortality (outcome) in the selected trauma population and within four clinically relevant subgroups using discrimination and calibration. RESULTS: 1,720,802 were trauma patients, and ICD-AIS mapping was possible in 1,328,377 cases. Cases with mapping failure (n = 392,425; 22.8%) were younger and had a higher mortality rate were excluded from the performance analysis. ICISS-derived scores had a better discrimination and calibration than ICD-AIS based scores in the overall cohort and all four subgroups (area under the curve [AUC] ranges between 0.985 and 0.998 vs 0.886 and- 0.972, respectively). CONCLUSION: Empirically derived measures of injury severity were superior to ICD-AIS mapped scores in the GHD to predict mortality in pediatric trauma patients. Given the high percentage of mapping failure and high mortality among cases with single-coded injury, the single ICISS may be the most suitable measure of injury severity in this group of patients.',\n",

STUDY DESIGN: A nationwide PIMS-TS registry was established in Germany in May 2020, shortly after the first cases were described in the US and United Kingdom. The registry captured information on patient characteristics, clinical course, laboratory findings, imaging, and outcome. All pediatric hospitals in Germany, along with one in Austria, were invited to participate. Between March 18, 2020, and April 30, 2023, 920 cases were reported. RESULTS: By examining a combination of data on clinical features, laboratory findings, treatment, imaging results, and outcomes, our analysis demonstrated disease severity to have continuously declined over the course of the Wildtype, Alpha, Delta, and Omicron waves. Based on clinical symptoms, laboratory and diagnostic findings, and intensive care unit admission rates, older children, irrespective of the related VOC, were shown to experience more severe, acute PIMS-TS; however, they had lower rates of coronary aneurysm. CONCLUSIONS: During the course of COVID-19 pandemic, as each new VOC emerged, PIMS-TS lessened in severity. In parallel, older children came to experience more debilitating disease.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'OBJECTIVES: From September 2022 an increase in Corynebacterium diphtheriae (C. diphtheriae) infections was reported in Europe. Our study focuses on 31 adolescent and young adult refugees with cutaneous C. diphtheriae infections detected in Germany. We examined treatment regimens and outcomes to provide targeted insights into the management of this infection. METHODS: We distributed a standardized survey, focused on children and adolescents presenting to paediatric clinics through the German Paediatric Infectious Diseases Society (DGPI) and additional professional contacts in Germany. Data were extracted from routine medical documentation and reported anonymously. RESULTS: A total of 31 individuals with cutaneous C. diphtheriae infection were reported by 9 centres. Two of these showed diphtheria toxin (DT) related systemic symptoms and four exhibited systemic inflammation requiring complex management. The remaining 25 cases, with exclusively cutaneous manifestations, were afebrile. Treatment with topical antiseptics and systemic antibiotics, mainly aminopenicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitors (BLI) (35%) or clindamycin (25%), achieved eradication in all but two cases treated with aminopenicillin/BLI. Treatment duration varied between 5 and 17 days. CONCLUSIONS: In refugees presenting with chronic skin wounds, C. diphtheriae should be included into the differential diagnosis. Fever seems to be a valuable marker to differentiate severe cases with potentially DT-mediated sequelae from exclusively cutaneous diphtheria (CD). For afebrile CD, topical antiseptics and oral antibiotic therapy with clindamycin for 7 days, followed by clinical surveillance appears to be a safe treatment regimen. Patients with CD who present with fever or pharyngitis should be thoroughly investigated including blood and pharyngeal swab cultures.',\n",

       "               'AB': \"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A number of case reports have documented the occurrence of acute hepatic and renal toxicity during treatment with deferasirox (DFX). The precise mechanisms underlying these adverse events remain unclear, with the time to toxicity varying considerably between patients-some experiencing it within weeks of treatment initiation, while others after several years. Recent studies have underscored the association of pharmacogenetic variants in genes responsible for the metabolism and clearance of DFX (ABCC2, ABCG2, and UGT1A1) in the development of toxicity. We present the case of an 8-year-old patient with beta thalassemia major who developed acute hepatic failure years after the initiation of DFX therapy. After ruling out the most likely causes, we performed a pharmacogenetic analysis, which suggested a possible link between the patient's genotype and the development of toxicity. METHODS: Sanger sequencing was performed for the most extensively studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) studied associated with changes in transporter/enzyme function: ABCC2 rs717620 (c.-24C>T), rs2273697 (c.1249G>A), rs8187710 (c.4544G>A), rs369192412 (g.99781071delG); ABCG2 rs2231142 (c.421C>A); UGT1A1 *6 rs4148323 (c.211G>A), *28 rs3064744 (g.233760235TA[8]), *36 rs3064744 (g.233760235TA[6]) and *37 rs3064744 (g.233760235TA[9]). RESULTS: The patient is heterozygous for two ABCC2 variants, namely rs717620 (c.-24C>T) and rs2273697 (c.1249G>A). These variants have the potential to cause a reduction in transporter function, which could in turn result in decreased drug clearance and increased toxicity. DISCUSSION: The precise mechanism by which toxicity developed in this case remains unclear and is likely multifactorial. However, it is probable that the presence of SNPs in the gene ABCC2 played a substantial role. Our findings align with those of previously published reports of remarkably similar cases, where patients also exhibited genetic variants in the gene ABCC2.\",\n",

       "               'AB': \"INTRODUCTION: Parents of preterm infants face a stressful life event which might have long term impact on the parent-child relation as well as on the infant's cognitive and socio-emotional development. Both music therapy (MT) and physical contact (PC) are stress-reducing interventions for parents and preterm infants on the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Meanwhile, especially close PC is considered as standard care (SC) in most NICUs. However, the effect of live performed MT with PC on parental perceived stress and cortisol levels has barely been investigated. We hypothesized that MT with PC leads to reduced stress levels and lower salivary cortisol concentrations compared to SC in parents of preterm infants during the first 4 weeks after birth. METHODS: Randomized-controlled trial enrolling the parents of 99 preterm infants (MT n = 50, SC n = 49 infants). The infants received either MT with PC or SC only. Perceived stress was measured with the perceived stress questionnaire 20 (PSQ-20) after birth and 4 weeks later. Salivary cortisol levels were obtained and measured weekly after birth for 4 weeks. RESULTS: Forty-two mothers and eight fathers of the intervention group (MT with PC) as well as n = 43 mothers and n = 6 fathers of the control group (SC) were enrolled. For the intervention group, salivary cortisol was reduced 4 weeks after birth [mothers 5.5 nmol/l (confidence interval (CI) 3.6-7.5); fathers 8.3 (CI 7.2-9.4)] compared to the control group [mothers 10.3 nmol/l (CI 5.4-15.3); fathers 14.8 (CI 8.9-20.7)]. Overall perceived stress scores decreased in the intervention group (mothers -17.6; fathers -12.6) and increased in the control group (mothers +6.1; fathers +21.4) over 4 weeks. DISCUSSION: Live-performed MT with PC in preterm infants might be an effective, non-invasive intervention to reduce parental stress and cortisol levels. Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of this intervention on the parent-infant relation as well as on the infants' cognitive and socio-emotional development.

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Overuse and misuse of antibiotics is one of the driving factors of antimicrobial resistance, a growing global health threat. The use of antibiotics is particularly high in children. Even though the implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs (ASP) in pediatrics has been shown to reduce antibiotic use, this implementation has been limited to large university hospitals in Germany. Telemedicine applications might be an effective approach to implement ASP in non-university settings. METHODS: This protocol details the TeleKasper study (Telemedical Competence Network \"Antibiotic Stewardship in Pediatrics\"). Tele-Kasper is a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial that will be conducted across non-university children\\'s hospitals in Germany. The intervention consists of a telemedical consultation service in the form of a network in different German areas, using an app as a communication tool. The primary outcome will be a 20% reduction in overall antibiotic consumption measured using defined daily doses per 100 patient days. DISCUSSION: The TeleKasper study aims to implement and evaluate a prototype for a nationwide antibiotic stewardship program by telemedical means in pediatric departments in non-university hospitals in Germany to promote rational antibiotic use and improve medical care for infections.

       "               'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer entails a heavy burden for patients and their families. Recent advances in overall survival rates have increasingly brought long-term quality of life into focus. Animal-assisted activities (AAAs) have long been hypothesized to alleviate the burden on pediatric patients and their peers in the hospital setting. However, their use in inpatient pediatric oncology has been a sensitive issue mainly due to the fear of infections, resulting in a lack of studies. This study presents data on the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of AAAs from a single German center. METHODS: Between 2018 and 2022, 60 patients (median age = 10.3 years) diagnosed with malignancy and undergoing treatment were visited by an intervention dog (total visits = 100). Patients were screened for infections as per hospital policy, with additional microbiological testing performed based on symptoms. The dog was screened for human pathogens and zoonoses. Microbial data and hospitalizations were analyzed from two months prior to the first visit until two months after the last visit. Acceptance of being in the hospital, both with and without planned animal-assisted interventions and pre- and post-intervention state stress, were measured using a validated visual analogue scale (0-10). RESULTS: Patients benefited from AAAs, showing increased acceptance of being in the hospital (median: 7.25 vs. 4.50, P < 0.001) and decreased median state stress ratings one hour after the visit compared to one hour before the visit (1.00 vs. 4.25, P < 0.001). The intervention did not result in an increased number of infections or unplanned hospitalizations, and no zoonoses were detected. All microbial screening tests of the dog were negative. CONCLUSIONS: AAAs with visiting dogs in inpatient pediatric oncology are feasible and safe. Although they hold promise for enhancing patients' well-being, further prospective studies are needed.

       "               'AB': \"IMPORTANCE: Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a major morbidity of preterm infants causing visual impairment, including blindness, for which timely treatment is vital and prevention is key. Increasing evidence suggests that exposure to neonatal sepsis contributes to ROP development. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between neonatal sepsis and ROP in 2 large-scale cohorts of preterm infants born at less than 29 weeks' gestation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the German Neonatal Network (GNN) and Norwegian Neonatal Network (NNN). The GNN involves 68 and the NNN includes 21 level III neonatal intensive care units. Participants were infants born at a gestation of 22 weeks and 0 days to 28 weeks and 6 days and enrolled in the GNN between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2022, and NNN between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2018. Data were analyzed from February through September 2023. EXPOSURE: Single or multiple episodes of culture-proven sepsis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Any ROP and treatment-warranted ROP. RESULTS: Among 12\\u202f794 infants in the GNN (6043 female [47.2%] and 6751 male [52.8%]; mean [SD] gestational age, 26.4 [1.5] weeks) and 1844 infants in the NNN (866 female [47.0%] and 978 male [53.0%]; mean [SD] gestational age, 25.6 [1.5] weeks), the mean (SD) birth weight was 848 (229) g and 807 (215) g, respectively. Any ROP was present in 6370 infants (49.8%) in GNN and 620 infants (33.6%) in NNN, and treatment-warranted ROP was present in 840 infants (6.6%) in GNN and 140 infants (7.6%) in NNN. In both cohorts, there were increasing rates of treatment-warranted ROP with each sepsis episode (no sepsis: 572 of 10\\u202f658 infants [5.4%] in GNN and 85 of 1492 infants (5.7%) in NNN; 1 episode: 190 of 1738 infants in GNN [10.9%] and 29 of 293 infants [9.9%] in NNN; 2 episodes: 53 of 314 infants in GNN [16.9%] and 13 of 49 infants [26.5%] in NNN; 3 episodes: 25 of 84 infants [29.8%] in GNN and 3 of 10 infants [30.0%] in NNN). After adjusting for multiple confounders in the GNN dataset, the number of sepsis episodes was associated with ROP and treatment-warranted ROP compared with 0 episodes (1 episode: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.44 [95% CI, 1.27-1.63]; P < .001 and OR, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.31-1.96]; P < .001, respectively; 2 episodes: OR, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.35-2.42]; P < .001 and OR, 2.38 [95% CI, 1.68-3.37]; P < .001, respectively; 3 episodes: OR, 4.39 [95% CI, 2.19-8.78]; P < .001 and OR, 3.88 [95% CI, 2.29-6.55]; P < .001, respectively). These associations were confirmed for any ROP by propensity score matching (for example, the aOR with propensity score matching was 1.76 [95% CI, 1.54-2.02]; P < .001 for 1 episode vs 0 episodes and 1.58 [95% CI, 1.12-2.22]; P = .007 for 3 episodes vs 0 or 1 episode). In the NNN dataset, surgical NEC was associated with treatment-warranted ROP (multivariable analysis: aOR, 3.37 [95% CI, 1.78-6.37]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that in the large-scale GNN cohort, recurrent culture-proven sepsis was associated with ROP and treatment-warranted ROP in infants born at less than 29 weeks.\",\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: In spite of improved survival rates after pediatric liver transplantation, infections remain major contributors to perioperative morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to understand the impact of type and duration of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) on the occurrence of surgical site infections (SSIs). METHODS: In total, 125 patients who underwent liver transplantation between 2014 and 2020 were retrospectively included. Patients were categorized into two periods based on changes in the standard PAP regimen. Risk factors for SSIs were investigated, including the influence of PAP duration, antibiotic substances used, and abdominal patch placement using multivariable regression models. RESULTS: SSIs occurred in 23 (19%) of 119 analyzed patients and were not impacted by changes in the PAP regimen. The placement of an abdominal patch was a relevant risk factor for SSIs (odds ratio 3.81; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-12.68). Longer PAP duration reduced the occurrence of SSIs by up to 4.6 percentage points (95% CI 0.0-9.1) per day, with its effect diminishing with longer duration. The choice of antibiotic substances for PAP changed after implementation of the new protocol, with a decline in vancomycin usage from 14% to 3%. CONCLUSION: The results of this study emphasize the need for evidence-based PAP regimens tailored to the unique needs of pediatric liver transplant recipients. The occurrence of SSIs remains complex and is influenced by various factors beyond the PAP regimen. Multicentric efforts to develop effective prevention strategies against SSIs in this vulnerable population are warranted.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'IMPORTANCE: In neonates with birth asphyxia (BA) and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, therapeutic hypothermia (TH), initiated within six hours, is the only safe and established neuroprotective measure to prevent secondary brain injury. Infants born outside of TH centers have delayed access to cooling. OBJECTIVE: To compare in-hospital mortality, occurrence of seizures, and functional status at discharge in newborns with BA depending on postnatal transfer for treatment to another hospital within 24 h of admission (transferred (TN) versus non-transferred neonates (NTN)). DESIGN: Nationwide retrospective cohort study from a comprehensive hospital dataset using codes of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th modification (ICD-10). Clinical and outcome information was retrieved from diagnostic and procedural codes. Hierarchical multilevel logistic regression modeling was performed to quantify the effect of being postnatally transferred on target outcomes. SETTING: All discharges from German hospitals from 2016 to 2021. PARTICIPANTS: Full term neonates with birth asphyxia (ICD-10 code: P21) admitted to a pediatric department on their first day of life. EXPOSURES: Postnatal transfer to a pediatric department within 24 h of admission to an external hospital. MAIN OUTCOMES: In-hospital death; secondary outcomes: seizures and pediatric complex chronic conditions category (PCCC) >/= 2. RESULTS: Of 11,703,800 pediatric cases, 25,914 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. TNs had higher proportions of organ dysfunction, TH, organ replacement therapies, and neurological sequelae in spite of slightly lower proportions of maternal risk factors. In TNs, the adjusted odds ratios (OR) for death, seizures, and PCCC >/= 2 were 4.08 ((95% confidence interval 3.41-4.89), 2.99 (2.65-3.38), and 1.76 (1.52-2.05), respectively. A subgroup analysis among infants receiving TH (n = 3,283) found less pronounced adjusted ORs for death (1.67 (1.29-2.17)) and seizures (1.26 (1.07-1.48)) and inverse effects for PCCC >/= 2 (0.81 (0.64-1.02)) in TNs. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: This comprehensive nationwide study found increased odds for adverse outcomes in neonates with BA who were transferred to another facility within 24 h of hospital admission. Closely linking obstetrical units to a pediatric department and balancing geographical coverage of different levels of care facilities might help to minimize risks for postnatal emergency transfer and optimize perinatal care.',\n",

       "               'AB': \"OBJECTIVE: Music therapy (MT) is proposed to enrich the acoustic environment of very preterm infants (VPT) on the neonatal intensive care unit during a vulnerable period of brain development. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of MT on the white matter (WM) microstructure. It is hypothesized that MT affects WM integrity in VPT. METHODS: Randomized controlled trial enrolling infants born <32 weeks' gestation. Infants were randomized to MT or standard care. Live MT was provided twice weekly from the second postnatal week onwards by a trained music therapist. At term equivalent age, participants underwent a cranial magnetic resonance imaging scan including sequences for diffusion tensor imaging analysis. Differences in WM microstructure were assessed using tract based spatial statistics with fractional anisotropy. RESULTS: Of 80 infants enrolled, 42 were eligible for diffusion tensor imaging analysis (MT: n = 22, standard care: n = 20). While primary tract based spatial statistics analysis revealed no significant differences between groups, post hoc analysis with uncorrected p-values and a significance threshold of p < 0.01 revealed significant fractional anisotropy differences in several WM tracts including the bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus, the left forceps minor and left fasciculus uncinatus, the corpus callosum, the left external capsule, and the right corticospinal tract. CONCLUSION: Post hoc analysis results suggest an effect of MT on WM integrity in VPT. Larger studies including long-term outcome are necessary to confirm these effects of MT on WM microstructure and to assess its impact on clinical neurodevelopment.

Adding Doppler imaging expands the spectrum by providing information on the status of the vasculature and haemodynamics that may guide further diagnostic and clinical management. Doppler imaging may identify neonates with congenital or acquired vascular abnormalities such as perinatal stroke, sinuvenous thrombosis, vein of Galen malformation, dural sinus malformation, sinus pericranii, and developmental venous anomaly. These entities may need further investigation with complementary imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography, or conventional angiography.

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) is used to assess electrocortical activity in pediatric intensive care if (continuous) full channel EEG is unavailable but evidence regarding the meaning of suppressed aEEG amplitudes in children remains limited. This retrospective cohort study investigated the association of suppressed aEEG amplitudes in critically ill children with death or decline of neurological functioning at hospital discharge. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-five EEGs derived from individual patients <18 years in the pediatric intensive care unit at the University Hospital Essen (Germany) between 04/2014 and 07/2021, were converted into aEEGs and amplitudes analyzed with respect to age-specific percentiles. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) for death, and functional decline at hospital discharge in patients with bilateral suppression of the upper or lower amplitude below the 10th percentile were calculated. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were assessed. RESULTS: The median time from neurological insult to EEG recording was 2 days. PICU admission occurred due to neurological reasons in 43% and patients had high overall disease severity. Thirty-three (14%) patients died and 68 (29%) had a functional decline. Amplitude suppression was observed in 48% (upper amplitude) and 57% (lower amplitude), with unilateral suppression less frequent than bilateral suppression. Multivariable regression analyses yielded crude ORs between 4.61 and 14.29 and adjusted ORs between 2.55 and 8.87 for death and functional decline if upper or lower amplitudes were bilaterally suppressed. NPVs for bilaterally non-suppressed amplitudes were above 95% for death and above 83% for pediatric cerebral performance category Scale (PCPC) decline, whereas PPVs ranged between 22 and 32% for death and 49-52% for PCPC decline. DISCUSSION: This study found a high prevalence of suppressed aEEG amplitudes in critically ill children. Bilaterally normal amplitudes predicted good outcomes, whereas bilateral suppression was associated with increased odds for death and functional decline. aEEG assessment may serve as an element for risk stratification of PICU patients if conventional EEG is unavailable with excellent negative predictive abilities but requires additional information to identify patients at risk for poor outcomes.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'PURPOSE: Very low birth weight infants are cared for postnatally in the incubator because of adverse consequences of hypothermia. Data on the optimal weight of transfer to a warming crib are rare. The aim of this study was to determine the course of temperature and body weight during a standardized transfer to a warming crib at a set weight. METHODS: Prospective intervention study in very low birthweight infants who were transferred from the incubator to a warming crib at a current weight between 1500 g and 1650 g. RESULTS: No infant had to be transferred back to an incubator. Length of hospital stay was equal compared to a historical cohort from the two years directly before the intervention. The intervention group showed an increase in the volume fed orally on the day after transfer to the warming crib, although this did not translate into an earlier discontinuation of gavage feedings. Compared to the historical group, infants in the intervention group could be transferred to an unheated crib at an earlier postmenstrual age and weight. CONCLUSIONS: Early transfer from the incubator to a warming crib between 1500 g and 1650 g is feasible and not associated with adverse short-term events or outcomes.

       "               'AB': \"There is evidence that music therapy combined with physical contact to parents stabilizes the vital signs of hospitalized preterm infants. Yet, there is no evidence for the difference between simple contact by touching the infant in the incubator or cod, or close physical contact during music therapy sessions (MT). Behavioral effects of the various forms of attention toward the infant during therapy need to be elucidated. Our study aimed to quantify the effects of hand touch contact (HTC) and close physical contact (CPC) during live performed MT in preterm infants regardless of gestational age on behavioral state (assessed via COMFORTneo scale) and vital signs. A maximum of ten live music therapy sessions were delivered three to four times a week until hospital discharge to 50 stable infants. Pre-, during- and post-therapy heart rates, respiratory rates, oxygen saturations and COMFORTneo scores were recorded for each session. A total of 486 sessions was performed with 243 sessions using HTC and CPC each. The mean gestational age was 33 + 3 weeks, with 27 (54%) infants being male. We observed lower COMFORTneo scores, heart and respiratory rates and higher oxygen saturation during and after live performed music therapy independent of the kind of physical contact than before therapy. While pre-therapy values were better in the CPC group for all four variables, a higher mean response on COMFORTneo scale and vital signs was observed for HTC (COMFORTneo score -5.5, heart rate -12.4 beats per min., respiratory rate -8.9 breaths per min, oxygen saturation + 1.5%) compared to CPC (COMFORTneo score -4.6, heart rate -9.6 beats per min., respiratory rate -7.0 breaths per min, oxygen saturation + 1.1%). Nonetheless, post-therapy values were better for all four measures in the CPC group. Regression modeling with correction for individual responses within each patient also yielded attenuated effects of MT in the CPC group compared to HTC, likely caused by the improved pre-therapy values. Live performed music therapy benefits preterm infants' vital signs and behavioral state. During CPC with a parent, the absolute therapeutic effect is attenuated but resulting post-therapy values are nonetheless better for both the COMFORTneo scale and vital signs.\",\n",

The Narcotrendindex (NI) offers uninterrupted information by continuous electrocortical monitoring without the need to apply a stimulus with the risk of assessment-induced arousal. This study aimed to explore the correlation between NI and the Comfort Scale (CS) during procedural sedation with midazolam and propofol and to identify an NI target range for deep sedation. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted on 176 children (6 months to 17.9 years) undergoing procedural sedation with midazolam premedication and continuous propofol infusion. Statistical analyses included Pearson correlation of NI and CS values, logistic regression, and receiver operating curves. Results: Median NI values varied with CS and age. The correlation coefficient between CS and NI was 0.50 and slightly higher in procedure-specific subgroup analyses. The optimal NI cut-off for deep sedation was between 50 and 60 depending on the analyzed subgroup and displayed high positive predictive values for sufficient sedation throughout. Conclusion: Our study found a moderate correlation between NI and CS, demonstrating reliable identification of adequately sedated patients.',\n",

       "               'AB': \"Introduction: Structured and standardized follow-up care for preterm and high-risk infants enables an early detection of developmental deficits. The aim is to adapt the in-person follow-up to video consultation. Developmental delays can thus be identified at an early stage, independently of in-person contact. Methods: The adaptation of these follow-up to video consultation is presented descriptively, compared with the in-person consultation (similarities, differences, challenges, and limitations). Professionals's experiences with the adaption are described. Results: The experience of n = 267 video consultations for follow-up of children up to 6 years shows that an adaptation of the in-person consultation is necessary and possible. Prerequisite is a digital medium with a stable internet connection on both sides: the professional and the family, as well as a portal for video consultations with certified, encrypted data transmission. Among infants, testing is almost entirely parent guided. For older children, testing procedures have been adapted. A neurological examination is largely possible, while a general pediatric examination is omitted. A survey on professionals' (n = 7) experiences with video- and in-person consultations found that the rate of complete follow-up visits and the resources required for taking medical histories, personnel, and time remained constant for both approaches. All reported that the video consultation is generally suitable for identifying developmental delays in children up to an age of 6 years comparable with in-person consultations. One professional stated that the physical examination of children aged >/=1 year is impossible. Discussion: Video consultation is an alternative despite some limitations when an in-person consultation is impossible. Developmental delays can be identified, and therapies recommended.\",\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: For management of severe traumatic brain injuries (sTBI) in children, the overall level of evidence to guide diagnostic and therapeutic procedures is low. Since 2016, international guidelines have subsequently suggested invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring in patients with initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) </=8. In Germany, ICP monitoring was an individual case decision from 2011 until the 2022 update of the German pediatric TBI guideline. The aim of this study was to evaluate current clinical practice of invasive ICP monitoring in Germany in children <10 years with respect to guideline recommendations. METHODS: Anonymized clinical data on sTBI cases <10 years of age were collected in a nationwide prospective surveillance study via the German Pediatric Surveillance Unit ESPED from July 2019 until June 2022. Inclusion criteria for the surveillance study were sTBI (initial GCS </=8) or neurosurgery following TBI. For this analysis, only cases with GCS </=8 were subject to the present analysis. Descriptive analyses were performed to assess the proportion of ICP monitored patients and describe the cohort. RESULTS: Out of 217 reported cases, 102 cases met the inclusion criteria and thus qualified for ICP monitoring. Of these, 37 (36%) received ICP monitoring. Monitored patients were older, had lower median GCS values at presentation (4 vs. 5), higher mortality (32% vs. 22%), and were more frequently diagnosed with cerebral edema (68% vs. 37%). CONCLUSION: In children <10 years with sTBI, the present clinical management regarding ICP monitoring deviates from the current German national and international guidelines. The reasons remain unclear, with the low level of evidence in the field of ICP monitoring and the recency of changes in guideline recommendations as potential contributors. Prospective interventional studies should elucidate the benefit of ICP monitoring and ICP directed therapies to provide evidence-based recommendations on ICP monitoring.',\n",

This study assessed hospitalizations and disease severity of community-acquired bacterial infections with S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, and H. influenzae among children in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany, during the last quarter of 2022 compared to long-term incidences. METHODS: Hospital cases due to bacterial infections between October and December 2022 were collected in a multicenter study (MC) from 59/62 (95%) children's hospitals in NRW and combined with surveillance data (2016-2023) from the national reference laboratories for streptococci, N. meningitidis, and H. influenzae. Overall and pathogen-specific incidence rates (IR) from January 2016 to March 2023 were estimated via capture-recapture analyses. Expected annual deaths from the studied pathogens were calculated from national death cause statistics. RESULTS: In the MC study, 153 cases with high overall disease severity were reported with pneumonia being most common (59%, n = 91). IRs of bacterial infections declined at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and massively surged to unprecedented levels in late 2022 and early 2023 (overall hospitalizations 3.5-fold), with S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae as main drivers (18-fold and threefold). Observed deaths during the study period exceeded the expected number for the entire year in NRW by far (7 vs. 0.9). DISCUSSION: The unprecedented peak of bacterial infections and deaths in late 2022 and early 2023 was caused mainly by S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae. Improved precautionary measures are needed to attenuate future outbreaks.\",\n",

Morphological lung changes are aggravated with disease progression. The aim of this study was to determine whether morphological lung changes differ between patients with CF (pwCF) who have MH and pwCF without MH. METHODS: Chest computed tomography (CT) scans of pwCF and MH acquired at a maximum of 4 months prior to MH (1/2008 to 2/2015) were evaluated for morphological changes and bronchial artery (BA) diameters. Lung lobes with MH were compared with lobes without MH and with matched control patients with end-stage CF and no hemoptysis using the Helbich scoring system. RESULTS: The study included 26 patients with MH (P(MH); 15 female, median age 29 years, interquartile range [IQR]: 25-33.75) and 17 matched control patients (11 male, median age 24 years, IQR: 19.5-30). No difference in Helbich score was detected between lobes with MH and matched control patients (p\\u202f= 0.051). Higher scores were detected in lobes with MH compared to lobes without MH in P(MH) (p\\u202f= 0.021), but no difference was detected in the subscores. The BA diameters were larger in P(MH) (p\\u202f= 0.02); 85% of P(MH) had unilateral MH, with 65% of MH involving only one or two lobes. CONCLUSION: Morphological changes are more severe in lobes with MH in the same patient, but there is no difference when compared with matched control patients. Besides abscess/sacculation, no specific changes for MH were identified. Other factors such as BA hypertrophy might play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of MH in pwCF. Commonly used scores to evaluate chest CT in pwCF cannot be used to assess MH, and other factors, e.g., hypertrophied BA, not represented and not measured in these scores, might be more suitable for assessing the risk for MH.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'Children and adolescents with severe neurological impairment (SNI) require specialized care due to their complex medical needs. In particular, these patients are often affected by severe and recurrent lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). These infections, including viral and bacterial etiology, pose a significant risk to these patients, often resulting in respiratory insufficiency and long-term impairments. Using expert consensus, we developed clinical recommendations on the management of LRTIs in children and adolescents with SNI. These recommendations emphasize comprehensive multidisciplinary care and antibiotic stewardship. Initial treatment should involve symptomatic care, including hydration, antipyretics, oxygen therapy, and respiratory support. In bacterial LRTIs, antibiotic therapy is initiated based on the severity of the infection, with aminopenicillin plus a beta-lactamase inhibitor recommended for community-acquired LRTIs and piperacillin-tazobactam for patients with chronic lung disease or tracheostomy. Ongoing management includes regular evaluations, adjustments to antibiotic therapy based on pathogen identification, and optimization of supportive care. Implementation of these recommendations aims to improve the diagnosis and treatment of LRTIs in children and adolescents with SNI. What is Known: * Children and adolescents with severe neurological impairment are particularly affected by severe and recurrent lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). * The indication and choice of antibiotic therapy for bacterial LRTI is often difficult because there are no evidence-based treatment recommendations for this heterogeneous but vulnerable patient population; the frequent overuse of broad-spectrum or reserve antibiotics in this patient population increases selection pressure for multidrug-resistant pathogens. What is New: * The proposed recommendations provide a crucial framework for focused diagnostics and treatment of LRTIs in children and adolescents with severe neurological impairment. * Along with recommendations for comprehensive and multidisciplinary therapy and antibiotic stewardship, ethical and palliative care aspects are taken into account.',\n",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of pediatric acute mastoiditis in the setting of acute otitis media as well as pediatric orbital complications in the setting of acute rhinosinusitis. Data from before the pandemic were compared to data after the end of the COVID-19 restrictions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Included were hospitalized children who presented with acute mastoiditis from acute otitis media or with orbital complications from acute rhinosinusitis during the period from April 2017 to March 2023. Compared were three periods using descriptive statistics: April 2017 to March 2020 (before the pandemic in Germany), April 2020 to March 2022 (during the contact restrictions of the pandemic), and April 2022 to March 2023 (after the contact restrictions were lifted). RESULTS: A total of 102 children (43 with acute mastoiditis, 42%, and 59 with orbital complications of acute sinusitis, 58%) were included. During the 2022/2023 period, more than twice as many children with acute mastoiditis and approximately three times as many children with orbital complications of acute rhinosinusitis were hospitalized compared to the average of the periods 2017/2018, 2018/2019, and 2019/2020. In the 2021/2022 period, the number of these patients was below the average of previous years. CONCLUSION: This year's seasonal cluster of upper respiratory tract infections is associated with a higher-than-average incidence of orbital complications and mastoiditis.\",\n",

In pediatric patients, little is known about the role of Mucorales in airway colonization and infection or their role as contaminants of respiratory samples. Currently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most sensitive mode of detection Mucorales in clinical specimen. In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of Mucorales in bronchoalveolar lavage samples (BAL) from a large, diverse group of pediatric patients. We performed commercial Mucorales PCR (MucorGenius(R), Pathonostics, Maastricht, NL, USA) on 102 thawed BAL samples of 100 patients. Mucorales PCR was negative in all samples. Our data suggest that Mucorales spp. have a low prevalence in paediatric airways and do not frequently contaminate pediatric BAL samples.',\n",

Parameters to foresee clinical progression and allow individualized parent counseling are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate aortic steal measured by Doppler ultrasound as a prognostic parameter in these neonates. METHODS: A retrospective monocentric analysis of cardiac ultrasound exams before embolization in neonates with VGAM was conducted. Percentage of aortic steal measured by time-averaged maximum velocity above and below the zero flow baseline by pulsed Doppler ultrasound at the preductal aortic isthmus was calculated. Association of aortic steal with parameters of acute organ dysfunction (Bicetre neonatal evaluation score [BNES], neonatal multiple organ dysfunction score [NeoMODS]) and mortality and determination of correlation between aortic steal and cerebral damage on initial and follow-up cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) were evaluated. RESULTS: Twelve neonates were included, of which 3 died. Per 10 percentage point increase of aortic steal, BNES decreased by 1.64 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28-2.0) points and the maximum observed NeoMODS increased by 1.25 (CI: 0.94-1.57) points. The odds for mortality increased by 2.3 (CI: 1.14-13.67) per 10 percentage point increase of aortic steal. There was a correlation between aortic steal and cerebral damage at baseline (white matter rho [rho] = 0.34, gray matter rho = 0.81) and follow-up (white matter rho = 0.80, gray matter rho = 0.72). CONCLUSION: The degree of aortic steal in neonates with VGAM was highly associated with the severity of organ dysfunction, disease progression on cMRI, and mortality.',\n",

This study examined the degree of depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress in mothers of preterm infants born before 32 gestational weeks depending on whether the infant received music therapy in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or not. We included 33 mothers of preterm infants enrolled in a previously described prospective randomized controlled trial, of whom 18 received music therapy (mean mothers' age 34.1 +/- 4.6 years) and 15 did not (mean mothers' age 29.6 +/- 4.2). The degree of depressive symptoms, anxiety and acute stress reactions of these mothers were measured by using the German version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) one week after birth (T1) and at infants' hospital discharge (T2). 605 music therapy sessions with a mean duration of 24.2 +/- 8.6 min (range 10 to 50 min) were conducted two times a week from the second week of life (T1) until discharge (T2) to the infants from the intervention group. The infants from the control group received standard medical care without music therapy. The mean total CES-D score decreased from T1 (mean 34.7, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 31.1-38.1) until T2 in all mothers (mean 16.3, 95% CI 12.6-20.1). Mothers whose infants received music therapy showed stronger declines of depressive and stress symptoms (with music therapy: CES-D mean difference of total score 25.7, 95% CI 20.0-31.3, IES-R mean difference of total score 1.7, 95% CI 0.9-2.5, IES-R mean difference of subcategory hyperarousal 10.2, 95% CI 6.2-14.3; without music therapy: CES-D mean difference of total score 9.5, 95% CI 3.8-15.3, IES-R mean difference of total score 0.1, 95% CI -1.0-1.2, IES-R mean difference of subcategory hyperarousal 1.6, 95% CI -4.7-7.9). Effect sizes were strong for CES-D, IES-R, and the hyperarousal subcategory, moderate for intrusion, and low for avoidance. These findings show that mothers of preterm infants are highly susceptible to supportive non-medical interventions such as music therapy to reduce psychological symptoms and distress during their infants' NICU stay.\",\n",

       "               'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Intensified treatment protocols have improved survival of pediatric oncology patients. However, these treatment protocols are associated with increased treatment-related morbidity requiring admission to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). We aimed to describe the organizational characteristics and processes of care for this patient group across PICUs in Europe. METHODS: A web-based survey was sent to PICU directors or representative physicians between February and June 2021. RESULTS: Responses were obtained from 77 PICUs of 12 European countries. Organizational characteristics were similar across the different countries of Europe. The median number of PICU beds was 12 (IQR 8-16). The majority of the PICUs was staffed by pediatric intensivists and had a 24/7 intensivist coverage. Most PICUs had a nurse-to-patient ratio of 1:1 or 1:2. The median numbers of yearly planned and unplanned PICU admissions of pediatric cancer patients were 20 (IQR 10-45) and 10 (IQR 10-30, respectively. Oncology specific practices within PICU were less common in participating centres. This included implementation of oncology protocols in PICU (30%), daily rounds of PICU physicians on the wards (13%), joint mortality and morbidity meetings or complex patients' discussions (30% and 40%, respectively) and participation of parents during clinical rounds (40%). CONCLUSION: Our survey provides an overview on the delivery of critical care for oncology patients in PICU across European countries. Multidisciplinary care for these vulnerable and challenging patients remains complex and challenging. Future studies need to determine the effects of differences in PICU organization and processes of care on patients' outcome.\",\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Absent or abnormal senses of smell and taste have been frequently reported during both acute and long COVID in adult patients. In contrast, pediatric patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 are often asymptomatic and the loss of smell and/or taste has been infrequently reported. After observing several young patients with COVID-associated anosmia and ageusia at our clinic, we decided to investigate the incidence of subsequent eating disorders in these patients and in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients who did not experience anosmia and ageusia during the same period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A single-site retrospective cohort study of 84 pediatric patients with suspected long COVID who were treated in the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Outpatient Clinic at the University Hospital Essen were evaluated for persistent symptoms of COVID-19. Smell and taste dysfunction as well as eating behaviors were among the signs and symptoms analyzed in this study. RESULTS: 24 out of 84 children and adolescents described smell and taste dysfunction after confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections. A large number of these patients (6 out of 24) demonstrated increased fixation on their eating behavior post-COVID and over time these patients developed anorexia nervosa. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: In this study we saw a possible association of long-lasting post-COVID smell and taste dysfunction with subsequent development of eating disorders. This observation is worrisome and merits further investigation by healthcare providers at multiple clinical sites.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Infections, major surgeries, and hyperinflammatory syndromes are known to trigger Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS). Discrimination between infectious and noninfectious inflammation often poses a challenge in chronically ill patients with multiple comorbidities. These patients are routinely treated with a variety of anti-infective medications before a pathogen is identified. With the goal of improving pathogen detection rates and interventions, we evaluated Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) as a highly sensitive and fast means of detecting free microbial DNA in a small amount of serum samples from children with ongoing SIRS. METHODS: We describe seven complex pediatric patients of SIRS or prolonged fever (>38.5  degrees C) >72 hours in which serum samples analyzed by NGS had a major impact on therapy. One patient was analyzed twice. RESULTS: In eight NGS there were six positive results (two bacterial, three viral, one fungal) which were subsequently confirmed by microbiological culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in five of the six NGS. In five of the eight performed NGS, results led to a change of therapy: antibiotic therapy was discontinued in two, escalated in one, an initiated in another; in one an antiviral was administered. CONCLUSIONS: NGS may become a valuable addition to infectious disease diagnostics in cases of pediatric SIRS. However, NGS has not yet been validated as a diagnostic method in pediatric as a diagnostic method in pediatric patients and results should therefore be interpreted with caution. Multi-center NGS evaluation studies are currently being planned.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Massive hemoptysis is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and advanced pulmonary disease. Hypertrophied bronchial arteries are understood to cause massive hemoptysis when rupturing. Risk factors to predict massive hemoptysis are scarce and bronchial artery diameters are not part of any scoring system in follow-up of patients with CF. Aim of this study was to correlate bronchial artery diameter with massive hemoptysis in CF. METHODS: Bronchial artery and non-bronchial systemic artery diameters were measured in contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans in patients with massive hemoptysis and compared to patients with end-stage CF and no history of hemoptysis. Demographic and clinical data and side of bronchial artery/non-bronchial systemic artery hypertrophy and coil embolization were documented. RESULTS: In this retrospective multicenter study 33 patients with massive hemoptysis were included for bronchial artery/non-bronchial systemic artery diameter measurements, (13 female, 20 male, median age 30 years (18-55)). Bronchial artery diameters were significantly larger in the case group than in the control group with median 4 mm (2.2-8.2 mm), and median 3 mm (1-7 mm), respectively (p = 0.002). Sensitivity of bronchial arteries >/= 3.5 mm to be associated with hemoptysis was 0.76 and specificity 0.71 with ROC creating an area under the curve of 0.719. If non-bronchial systemic arteries were present, they were considered culprit and embolized in 92% of cases. CONCLUSION: Bronchial arteries >/= 3.5 mm and presence of hypertrophied non-bronchial systemic arteries correlate with massive hemoptysis in patients with CF and might serve as risk predictor for massive hemoptysis. Therefore, in patients with advanced CF we propose CT scans to be carried out as CT angiography to search for bronchial arteries >/= 3.5 mm and for hypertrophied non-bronchial systemic arteries as possible risk factors for massive hemoptysis.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is regarded as a risk factor for brain injury in preterm infants. We herein hypothesize that extremely low birth weight infants (ELBWI, birth weight <1,000 g) having survived recurrent blood culture-proven late-onset sepsis (LOS) episodes are more likely to have an adverse long-term neurologic outcome. METHODS: In a large multicenter observational study of ELBWI </=28 6/7 weeks, we evaluated the impact of recurrent LOS (blood culture-proven, after day 7 of life) on development at 5-6 years. Neurodevelopment, behavior, and motor qualities were tested by blinded investigators. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 1343 ELBWI including 1,080 infants without LOS, 186 infants with one LOS, and 77 with recurrent LOS, i.e., 55 infants with two and 22 infants with three LOS episodes. After Bonferroni-Holm correction, multiple logistic regression analysis revealed recurrent sepsis to be significantly associated with adverse motor development (critical MABC-2 testing: 3.3 [1.5-7.3], p = 0.003, pB = 0.012), whereas no significant impact of recurrent LOS was found on intelligence quotient and behavioral difficulties. Odds of having critical motor testing results for infants with recurrent LOS were 1.7 times (95% confidence interval 1.4-2.3) that of infants with one LOS. CONCLUSION: Recurrent sepsis in preterm infants is associated with adverse long-term motor development. However, infants with recurrent infections are also more likely to have preterm-related complications, and reasons for a worse neurodevelopmental outcome remain to be elucidated.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'Heterogenous patient populations with small case numbers constitute a relevant barrier to research in pediatric critical care. Prospective studies bring along logistic barriers and-if interventional-ethical concerns. Therefore, retrospective observational investigations, mainly multicenter studies or analyses of registry data, prevail in the field of pediatric critical care research. Administrative health care data represent a possible alternative to overcome small case numbers and logistic barriers. However, their current use is limited by a lack of knowledge among clinicians about the availability and characteristics of these data sets, along with required expertise in the handling of large data sets. Specifically in the field of critical care research, difficulties to assess the severity of the acute disease and estimate organ dysfunction and outcomes pose additional challenges. In contrast, trauma research has shown that classification of injury severity from administrative data can be achieved and chronic disease scores have been developed for pediatric patients, nurturing confidence that the remaining obstacles can be overcome. Despite the undoubted challenges, interdisciplinary collaboration between clinicians and methodologic experts have resulted in impactful publications from across the world. Efforts to enable the estimation of organ dysfunction and measure outcomes after critical illness are the most urgent tasks to promote the use of administrative data in critical care. Clever analysis and linking of different administrative health care data sets carry the potential to advance observational research in pediatric critical care and ultimately improve clinical care for critically ill children.',\n",

We aimed to assess the impact of age and electrode position on aEEG amplitudes and derive normal values for pediatric aEEGs from neurologically healthy children. METHODS: Normal EEGs from awake children aged 1 month to 17 years (213 female, 237 male) without neurological disease or neuroactive medication were retrospectively converted into aEEGs. Two observers manually measured the upper and lower amplitude borders of the C3 - P3, C4 - P4, C3 - C4, P3 - P4, and Fp1 - Fp2 channels of the 10-20 system. Percentiles (10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th) were calculated for each age group (<1 year, 1 year, 2-5 years, 6-9 years, 10-13 years, 14-17 years). RESULTS: Amplitude heights and curves differed between channels without sex-specific differences. During the first 2 years of life, upper and lower amplitudes of all but the Fp1-Fp2 channel increased and then declined until 17 years. The decline of the upper Fp1-Fp2 amplitude began at 4 years, while the lower amplitude declined from the 1st year of life. CONCLUSIONS: aEEG interpretation must account for age and electrode positions but not for sex in infants and children.',\n",

       "               'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Sleep plays an important role for psychological and physical health, especially in infants at high risk for long-term neurodevelopmental impairment such as preterm infants. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed at determining risk factors for long-term sleep impairment in very-preterm (VPT; <32 weeks of gestation) infants. METHODS: Sleep problems were analyzed in an observational study in infants of the German Neonatal Network born between January 1st 2009 and December 31st 2014. Parental questionnaires of n = 2928 VPT children were evaluated regarding the child's sleep behavior at five years of age. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for delayed sleep onset and hyperactivity/inattention (Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire). In a second cohort of n = 342 VPT infants, sleep habits were evaluated at toddlers age via the Infant Sleep Questionnaire. RESULTS: In our cohorts, 424/2928 (14.5 %) preterm children were diagnosed with delayed sleep onset at early school age while 57/342 (16.7 %) had sleep impairment in early infancy. Gestational age was not independently associated with sleep problems (i.e., early school age: OR 0.97, 95 % CI 0.9-1.1, p = 0.15). Notably, in both our cohorts, neonatal exposure to analgesics and sedatives was associated with a higher risk for sleep problems, i.e., early school age: exposure to sedatives: OR 1.31, 95%CI 1.02-1.7, p = 0.03. Sleep problems and drug exposure were both associated with hyperactivity/inattention. CONCLUSION: Sleep problems of VPT children are unrelated to gestational age which suggests rather individual risk factors. The significant neonatal exposure to analgesics and sedatives may contribute to long-term sleep impairment.\",\n",

Our study aimed to quantify the effect of physical contact during live music therapy in preterm infants born < 32 weeks' gestational age (GA) on post-therapy vital sign values. Live music therapy was delivered twice-weekly until discharge from hospital to 40 stable infants < 32 weeks' GA. Baseline and post-therapy heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and physical contact during each session were recorded. 159 sessions were performed with, and 444 sessions without, physical contact. Descriptive and multivariable regression analyses based on directed acyclic graphs were performed. The mean GA was 28.6 +/- 2.6 weeks, and 26 (65%) infants were male. Mean absolute values for heart and respiratory rates lowered during music therapy regardless of physical contact. The mean post-therapy SaO2 was higher compared to baseline values regardless of physical contact (mean differences -8.6 beats/min; -13.3 breaths/min and +2.0%). There were no clinically relevant changes in vital sign responses between therapy sessions, with or without physical contact, or adjusted post-therapy values for any of the studied vital signs. Physical contact caused better baseline and post-therapy vital sign values but did not enhance the vital sign response to music therapy. Thus, the effect of music therapy on preterm infants' vital signs is independent of physical contact and parents' presence during music therapy in the neonatal intensive care unit.\",\n",

       "               'AB': \"IMPORTANCE: The inclusion of less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) in the care of preterm infants has been found to be beneficial for respiratory outcomes. Recently, the OPTIMIST trial found higher mortality rates in the subgroup of infants born at 25 to 26 weeks' gestational age (GA) who received surfactant treatment while spontaneously breathing. OBJECTIVE: To analyze outcomes among LISA-exposed, highly vulnerable babies born at less than 27 weeks' GA within the large-scale observational cohort of the German Neonatal Network. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study of data from 68 tertiary level neonatal intensive care units in Germany of infants born between 22 weeks 0 days to 26 weeks 6 days of gestation between April 1, 2009, and December 31, 2020, short-term outcomes among infants receiving LISA vs infants not receiving LISA were compared. EXPOSURE: Use of LISA within the first 72 hours of life. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were rates of LISA use, use of mechanical ventilation within the first 72 hours (considered failure of LISA), and association of LISA with outcomes, including death from all causes, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), death and BPD combined, pneumothorax, retinopathy of prematurity, intracerebral hemorrhage, and periventricular leukomalacia. To address potential confounding factors, multivariate logistic regression models were used. RESULTS: A total of 6542 infants (3030 [46.3%] female and 3512 [53.7%] male; mean [SD] GA, 25.3 (1.1) weeks; mean [SD] birth weight, 715 [180] g) were analyzed; 2534 infants (38.7%) received LISA, which was most frequently given quasi-prophylactically during delivery room management. Among the infants who received LISA, 1357 (53.6%) did not require mechanical ventilation in the first 72 hours compared with 331 infants (8.3%) of 4008 who did not receive LISA. In a multivariate logistic regression model that adjusted for GA, small-for-GA status, sex, multiple birth, inborn status, antenatal steroid use, and maximum fraction of inspired oxygen in the first 12 hours of life, LISA was associated with reduced risks of all-cause death (odds ratio [OR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61-0.90; P = .002), BPD (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.62-0.78; P < .001), and BPD or death (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.57-0.72; P < .001) compared with infants without LISA exposure. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this long-term multicenter cohort study suggest that LISA may be associated with reduced risks of adverse outcomes in extremely preterm infants.\",\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Childhood primary brain tumors (CPBT) are the second largest group of childhood malignancies and associated with a high risk for endocrine late effects. OBJECTIVE: To assess endocrine late effects and their relevance for the development of osteopathologies in survivors. METHODS: This single center cross sectional study investigated data from 102 CPBT survivors with a mean age of 13.0 years and a mean age at diagnosis of 8.7 years. Clinical, biochemical, radiographic, and anamnestic data regarding endocrine and bone health were obtained at study visits. In addition, data regarding tumor stage and therapy was obtained by chart review. An expert opinion was applied to define presence of osteopathologies. RESULTS: Impaired bone health, defined by at least one pathological screening parameter, was present in 65% of patients. 27.5% were found to have overt osteopathologies per expert opinion. 37.8% displayed a severe vitamin D deficiency (25-OH vitamin D < 10 ng/ml) and 11% a secondary hyperparathyroidism. Patients with osteopathologies had lower 25-OH vitamin D levels compared to patients without osteopathologies. Multiple endocrine late effects were present: diabetes insipidus in 10.8%, aberrant pubertal development in 13.7%, central hypocortisolism in 14.9%, thyroid dysfunction in 23.8% and growth hormone deficiency in 21.8%. A total of 31.3% of survivors displayed any endocrinopathy. Tumors located near hypothalamic structures and patients who received irradiation had a higher likelihood of endocrine morbidity. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that endocrine deficiencies are common in pediatric survivors of CPBTs. Osteopathologies are present in this cohort. A prominent effect of hormonal deficiencies on bone health was not detected, possibly because patients were sufficiently treate for their endocrine conditions or indicating resilience of the childhood bone remodeling process. Vitamin D deficiency is frequent and should be treated as recommended.',\n",

       "               'AB': \"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The worldwide severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic challenges adolescents' mental health. In this study, we aim to compare the number of pediatric ICU (PICU) admissions after suicide attempts during the first German lockdown and one year later during a second, prolonged lockdown with prepandemic years. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter study was conducted among 27 German PICUs. Cases <18 years admitted to the PICU because of accidents or injuries between March 16 and May 31 of 2017 to 2021 were identified based on International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes (German modification) and patient data entered into a database. This study is a subset analysis on suicide attempts in adolescents aged 12 to 17.9 years. The Federal Statistics Office was queried for data on fatal suicides, which were available only for 2020 in adolescents aged 10 to 17.9 years. RESULTS: Total admissions and suicide attempts declined during the first lockdown in 2020 (standardized morbidity ratio 0.74 (95% confidence interval; 0.58-0.92) and 0.69 (0.43-1.04), respectively) and increased in 2021 (standardized morbidity ratio 2.14 [1.86-2.45] and 2.84 [2.29-3.49], respectively). Fatal suicide rates remained stable between 2017 to 2019 and 2020 (1.57 vs 1.48 per 100 000 adolescent years) with monthly numbers showing no clear trend during the course of 2020. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a strong increase in serious suicide attempts among adolescents during the course of the pandemic in Germany. More research is needed to understand the relation between pandemic prevention measures and suicidal ideation to help implement mental health support for adolescents.\",\n",

       "               'AB': \"Children's and adolescents' lives drastically changed during COVID lockdowns worldwide. To compare accident- and injury-related admissions to pediatric intensive care units (PICU) during the first German COVID lockdown with previous years, we conducted a retrospective multicenter study among 37 PICUs (21.5% of German PICU capacities). A total of 1444 admissions after accidents or injuries during the first lockdown period and matched periods of 2017-2019 were reported and standardized morbidity ratios (SMR) were calculated. Total PICU admissions due to accidents/injuries declined from an average of 366 to 346 (SMR 0.95 (CI 0.85-1.05)). Admissions with trauma increased from 196 to 212 (1.07 (0.93-1.23). Traffic accidents and school/kindergarten accidents decreased (0.77 (0.57-1.02 and 0.26 (0.05-0.75)), whereas household and leisure accidents increased (1.33 (1.06-1.66) and 1.34 (1.06-1.67)). Less neurosurgeries and more visceral surgeries were performed (0.69 (0.38-1.16) and 2.09 (1.19-3.39)). Non-accidental non-suicidal injuries declined (0.73 (0.42-1.17)). Suicide attempts increased in adolescent boys (1.38 (0.51-3.02)), but decreased in adolescent girls (0.56 (0.32-0.79)). In summary, changed trauma mechanisms entailed different surgeries compared to previous years. We found no evidence for an increase in child abuse cases requiring intensive care. The increase in suicide attempts among boys demands investigation.\",\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in pediatric patients with underlying malignancies remains controversial. However, in an era in which the survival rates for children with malignancies have increased significantly and several recent reports have demonstrated effective ECMO use in children with cancer, we aimed to estimate the outcome and complications of ECMO treatment in these children. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases for studies on the use ECMO in pediatric patients with an underlying malignancy from inception to September 2020. This review was conducted in adherence to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis statement. Study eligibility was independently assessed by two authors and disagreements resolved by a third author. Included studies were evaluated for quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Random effects meta-analyses (DerSimonian and Laird) were performed. The primary outcomes were mortality during ECMO or hospital mortality. RESULTS: Thirteen retrospective, observational cohort studies were included, most of moderate quality (625 patients). The commonest indication for ECMO was severe respiratory failure (92%). Pooled mortality during ECMO was 55% (95% confidence interval [CI], 47-63%) and pooled hospital mortality was 60% (95% CI 54-67%). Although heterogeneity among the included studies was low, confidence intervals were large. In addition, the majority of the data were derived from registries with overlapping patients which were excluded for the meta-analyses to prevent resampling of the same participants across the included studies. Finally, there was a lack of consistent complications reporting among the studies. CONCLUSION: Significantly higher mortalities than in general PICU patients was reported with the use of ECMO in children with malignancies. Although these results need to be interpreted with caution due to the lack of granular data, they suggest that ECMO appears to represents a viable rescue option for selected patients with underlying malignancies. There is an urgent need for additional data to define patients for whom ECMO may provide benefit or harm.',\n",

METHODS: We retrieved medical records of 51 consecutive neonates >35 weeks with jaundice who were readmitted to the hospital, and compared to 164 controls. Data on gender, gestational age, birth weight, mode of delivery, feeding, bilirubin levels and breastfeeding counseling were analyzed. RESULTS: 24% babies were readmitted for hyperbilirubinemia reaching phototherapy level. Early term infants had significantly higher risk for readmission compared to term [OR (95% CI) 2.12 (0.99-4.53); P= 0.05]. The risk of readmission was lower amongst subjects receiving mixed/formula feeding [OR (95% CI) 0.51 (0.26-0.98); P=0.046] odds of readmission decreased for those feeding >8 times per day (OR (95% CI) 0.46 (0.23-0.91); P=0.016], and those who stayed in hospital for more than 2 days after birth [OR (95% CI) 0.95(0.93-0.97); P<0.001]. CONCLUSION: Ensuring feeding at least 8 times per day and keeping newborns beyond the first 24 hours decreases the chance of readmission.',\n",

       "               'AB': \"The effect of decompressive craniectomy (DC) on functional outcomes and mortality in children after severe head trauma is strongly debated. The lack of high-quality evidence poses a serious challenge to neurosurgeons' and pediatric intensive care physicians' decision making in critically ill children after head trauma. This study was conducted to compare DC and medical management in severely head-injured children with respect to short-term outcomes and mortality. Data on patients <18 years of age treated in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland during a 10-year period were extracted from TraumaRegister DGU((R)), forming a retrospective multi-center cohort study. Descriptive and multi-variable analyses were performed to compare outcomes and mortality after DC and medical management. Of 2507 patients, 402 (16.0%) received DC. Mortality was 20.6% after DC and 13.7% after medical management. Poor outcome (death or vegetative state) occurred in 27.6% after DC and in 16.1% after medical management. After risk adjustment by logistic regression modeling, the odds ratio was 1.56 (95% confidence interval 1.01-2.40) for poor outcome at intensive care unit discharge and 1.20 (0.74-1.95) for mortality after DC. In summary, DC was associated with increased odds for poor short-term outcomes in children with severe head trauma. This finding should temper enthusiasm for DC in children until a large randomized controlled trial has answered more precisely if DC in children is beneficial or increases rates of vegetative state.\",\n",

Potential adverse effects and selection of multi-drug resistant bacteria play minor roles in decision making. This narrative review first describes harm from antibiotics and second focuses on different aspects that could help to reduce antibiotic overtreatment without harming the patient: harm from antibiotic treatment, diagnostic approaches, role of biomarkers, timing of antibiotic therapy, empiric therapy, targeted therapy, and therapeutic drug monitoring. Wherever possible, we linked the described evidence to the current Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. Antibiotic stewardship programs should help guiding antibiotic therapy for critically ill children. IMPACT: Critically ill children can be harmed by inadequate or overuse of antibiotics. Hemodynamically unstable children with a suspicion of infection should be immediately treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. In contrast, in hemodynamically stable children with sepsis and organ dysfunction, a time frame of 3 h for proper diagnostics may be adequate before starting antibiotics if necessary. Less and more targeted antibiotic treatment can be achieved via antibiotic stewardship programs.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the natural course of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) in the pediatric population, with special emphasis on the risk of first and recurrent bleeding over a 5-year period. METHODS: Our institutional database was screened for patients with CCM treated between 2003 and 2020. Patients </=18 years of age with complete magnetic resonance imaging data set, clinical baseline characteristics, and >/=1 follow-up examination were included. Surgically treated individuals were censored after CCM removal. We assessed the impact of various parameters on first or recurrent intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) at diagnosis using univariate and multivariate logistic regression adjusted for age and sex. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the cumulative 5-year risk for (re)hemorrhage. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-nine pediatric patients with CCM were analyzed. Univariate logistic regression identified brain stem CCM (odds ratio, 3.15 [95% CI, 1.15-8.63]; P=0.026) and familial history of CCM (odds ratio, 2.47 [95% CI, 1.04-5.86]; P=0.041) as statistically significant predictors of ICH at diagnosis. Multivariate logistic regression confirmed this correlation (odds ratio, 3.62 [95% CI, 1.18-8.99]; P=0.022 and odds ratio, 2.53 [95% CI, 1.07-5.98]; P=0.035, respectively). Cox regression analysis identified ICH as mode of presentation (hazard ratio, 14.01 [95% CI, 1.80-110.39]; P=0.012) as an independent predictor for rehemorrhage during the 5-year follow-up. The cumulative 5-year risk of (re)bleeding was 15.9% (95% CI, 10.2%-23.6%) for the entire cohort, 30.2% (20.2%-42.3%) for pediatric patients with ICH at diagnosis, and 29.5% (95% CI, 13.9%-51.1%) for children with brain stem CCM. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with brain stem CCM and familial history of CCM have a higher risk of ICH as mode of presentation. During untreated 5-year follow-up, they revealed a similar risk of (re)hemorrhage compared to adult patients. The probability of (re)bleeding increases over time, especially in cases with ICH at presentation or brain stem localization.',\n",

In adults, APOE-epsilon4 genotype has been proposed as susceptibility factor for impaired recovery after cerebral insult. We here aim to determine APOE genotype-specific neurological consequences of neonatal ICH at school age. METHODS: In this multicenter observational cohort study, very low birth weight (<1500 g, <32 weeks gestational age) children were studied for cerebral palsy (CP) after ultrasound diagnosed ICH stratified by APOE genotype. Follow-up examination was done at the age of 5 to 6 years. Study personnel were blinded for perinatal information and complications. Participants were born between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2013 and enrolled in the German Neonatal Network. Of 8022 infants primarily enrolled, 2467 children were invited for follow-up between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2019. Univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the impact of APOE genotype (APOE-epsilon2, APOE-epsilon3, APOE-epsilon4) on CP after ICH. RESULTS: Two thousand two hundred fifteen children participated at follow-up, including 363 children with ultrasound diagnosed neonatal ICH. In univariate analyses of children with a history of ICH, APOE-epsilon3 carriers had lower frequencies of CP (n=33/250; 13.2 [95% CI, 9.4%-17.8%]), as compared to APOE-epsilon2 (n=15/63; 23.8 [14.6%-35.3%], P=0.037) and -epsilon4 carriers (n=31/107; 29.0 [21.0%-38.0%], P<0.001), respectively. Regression models revealed an association of APOE-epsilon4 genotype and CP development (odds ratio, 2.77 [1.44-5.32], P=0.002) after ICH. Notably, at low-grade ICH (grade I) APOE-epsilon4 expression resulted in an increased rate of CP (n=6/39; 15.4 [6.7-29.0]) in comparison to APOE-epsilon3 (n=2/105; 1.9 [0.4%-6.0%], P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: APOE-epsilon4 carriers have an increased risk for long-term motor deficits after ICH. We assume an effect even after low-grade neonatal ICH, but more data are needed to clarify this issue.',\n",

       "               'AB': \"In preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), a decision between early delivery with prematurity complications and pregnancy prolongation bearing the risk of chorioamnionitis has to be made. To define disadvantages of delayed prolongation, latency duration of PPROM in expectantly managed pregnancies was investigated. We included those PPROMs > 48 h leading to preterm birth prior 37 weeks' gestation and retrospectively analyzed 84 preterm infants fulfilling these criteria. The association between latency duration/appearance of PPROM and respiratory outcome (primary outcomes) and neurological outcome (secondary outcomes) was investigated. The study showed that latency duration of PPROM is not associated with clinical or histological chorioamnionitis (p = 0.275; p = 0.332). As the numerous clinical parameters show multicollinearity between each other, we performed a multiple regression analysis to consider this fact. Respiratory distress syndrome is significantly associated with gestational age at PPROM (p < 0.001), and surfactant application is significantly associated with PPROM duration (p = 0.014). The other respiratory parameters including steroids and diuretics therapy, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and the neurological parameters (intraventricular hemorrhage, Bayley II testing at a corrected age of 24 months) were not significantly associated with PPROM duration or gestational age at PPROM diagnosis.Conclusion: Latency duration of PPROM was not associated with adverse neonatal outcome in expectantly and carefully managed pregnancies, but respiratory distress syndrome was pronounced. The observed effect of pronounced respiratory distress syndrome can be treated with surfactant preparations and was not followed by increased rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. What is Known: * In case of preterm premature rupture of membranes, a decision between pregnancy prolongation with the risk of chorioamnionitis and early delivery with prematurity complications has to be made. * Chorioamnionitis is a dangerous situation for the pregnant woman and the fetus. * Impaired neurodevelopmental outcome is strongly correlated with pronounced prematurity due to the increased rate of serious complications. What is New: * Respiratory distress syndrome is significantly associated with gestational age at PPROM, and surfactant application is significantly associated with PPROM duration. * Latency duration of PPROM is not associated with adverse respiratory neonatal outcome (therapy with continuous positive airway pressure, therapy with diuretics and/or steroids, bronchopulmonary dysplasia) in expectantly and carefully managed pregnancies. * Intraventricular hemorrhage and Bayley II testing at a corrected age of 24 months are not associated with latency duration of PPROM when pregnancies are carefully observed.\",\n",

       "               'AB': 'INTRODUCTION: Interpretation of amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) is hindered by lacking knowledge on physiological background patterns in children. The aim of this study was to find out whether aEEG differs between wakefulness and sleep in children. METHODS: Forty continuous full-channel EEGs (cEEG) recorded during the afternoon and overnight in patients <18 years of age without pathologies or only solitary interictal epileptiform discharges were converted into aEEGs. Upper and lower amplitudes of the C3-C4, P3-P4, C3-P3, C4-P4, and Fp1-Fp2 channels were measured during wakefulness and sleep by two investigators and bandwidths (BW) calculated. Sleep states were assessed according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Median and interquartile ranges (IQR) were calculated to compare the values of amplitudes and bandwidth between wakefulness and sleep. RESULTS: Median age was 9.9 years (IQR 6.1-14.7). All patients displayed continuous background patterns. Amplitudes and BW differed between wakefulness and sleep with median amplitude values of the C3-C4 channel 35 muV (IQR: 27-49) for the upper and 13 muV (10-19) for the lower amplitude. The BW was 29 muV (21-34). During sleep, episodes with high amplitudes [upper: 99 muV (71-125), lower: 35 muV (25-44), BW 63 muV (44-81)] corresponded to sleep states N2-N3. High amplitude-sections were interrupted by low amplitude-sections, which became the longer toward the morning [upper amplitude: 39 muV (30-51), lower: 16 muV (11-20), BW 23 muV (19-31)]. Low amplitude-sections were associated with sleep states REM, N1, and N2. With increasing age, amplitudes and bandwidths declined. CONCLUSION: aEEGs in non-critically ill children displayed a wide range of amplitudes and bandwidths. Amplitudes were low during wakefulness and light sleep and high during deep sleep. Interpretation of pediatric aEEG background patterns must take into account the state of wakefulness in in clinical practice and research.',\n",

Most of these infants are treated on a neonatal intensive care unit immediately after birth, leading to psychosocial stress for parents and making it more difficult to build a stable parent-child bond. We hypothesized that accompaniment with live music therapy by a music therapist supports the parents to get in contact with their child and to promote the parents' wellbeing. Preterm infants born at less than 32 gestational weeks received creative music therapy twice a week until discharge. At the time of discharge, the parents were asked to complete a Likert-style questionnaire to evaluate the music therapy. Six items related to socio-demographic characteristics, 4 items to observations on the infant and 10 items to personal perception. Of 40 preterm infants receiving music therapy, 32 (80%) parents completed the questionnaires. Thirty (94%) of these parents were able to relax during the music therapy session. Relaxation in their infants was observed by 29 (91%) during and by 28 (88%) after music therapy. Parents perceived music therapy as a positive change and enrichment during their infant's hospital stay. All parents were thankful for the music therapy they received. Music therapy supports the parents of preterm infants in the first time after birth until discharge from the hospital.\",\n",

Methods:Based on diagnosis related groups from nation-wide hospital data, we extracted data on all TBI-related hospitalizations in children <18 years in Germany between 2014 and 2018. We calculated crude, age-specific and standardized incidence rates for hospitalizations, imaging, intracranial injury, neurosurgery, and mortality. Results:Out of 10.2 million hospitalizations, we identified 458,844 cases with TBI as primary or secondary diagnosis, resulting in a crude incidence rate of 687/100,000 child years (CY). Age-specific rates of computed tomography were below 30/100,000 CY until the age of 10 years and increased to 162/100,000 CY until 17 years of age. Intracranial injury was diagnosed in 2.7%, neurosurgery was performed in 0.7% of patients, and 0.7% were mechanically ventilated. Mortality was 0.67/100,000 CY (0.1%). Conclusions:Despite substantial hospitalization rates for pediatric TBI in Germany, the rates of imaging, the need for mechanical ventilation, neurosurgery and mortality were overall very low. Reasons for hospitalization and measures to reduce unnecessary admissions warrant further investigation.',\n",

       "               'AB': \"Recent research found evidence supporting music therapy for preterm infants to stabilize vital signs and possibly promote neurodevelopment. Even though preterm infants spend a considerable amount of time sleeping, the effectiveness of music therapy during sleep has not been studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of music therapy on preterm infants' vital signs with respect to the state of wakefulness. The first 20 consecutive infants born with <32 weeks' gestational age (GA) from the intervention group of an ongoing randomized controlled trial received live music therapy twice a week until hospital discharge. The heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and state of wakefulness were recorded before and after therapy. We observed significantly lower heart and respiratory rates and higher oxygen saturation after live music therapy sessions in general (mean differences -4.9 beats per min; -7.0 breaths per min and +1.5%, respectively). When music therapy was applied during sleep, respiratory rates significantly lowered by 8.8 breaths per min and oxygen saturation increased by 1.6%, whereas in the awake state the vital parameters did not significantly change (heart rate -5.2 beats per min; respiratory rate +0.6 breaths per min and oxygen saturation +1.0%). Music therapy stabilized the respiratory rates and oxygen saturations in sleeping preterm infants.\",\n",

       "               'AB': 'INTRODUCTION: Massive haemoptysis is a life-threatening event in advanced cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease with bronchial artery embolisation (BAE) as standard of care treatment. The aim of our study was to scrutinise short-term and long-term outcomes of patients with CF and haemoptysis after BAE using coils. METHODS: We carried out a retrospective cohort study of 34 adult patients treated for massive haemoptysis with super selective bronchial artery coil embolisation (ssBACE) between January 2008 and February 2015. Embolisation protocol was restricted to the culprit vessel(s) and three lobes maximum. Demographic data, functional end-expiratory volume in 1 s in % predicted (FEV1% pred.) and body mass index before and after ssBACE, sputum colonisation, procedural data, time to transplant and time to death were documented. RESULTS: Patients treated with ssBACE showed significant improvement of FEV(1)% pred. after embolisation (p=0.004) with 72.8% alive 5 years post-ssBACE. Mean age of the patients was 29.9 years (+/-7.7). Mean FEV(1)% pred. was 45.7% (+/-20.1). Median survival to follow-up was 75 months (0-125). Severe complication rate was 0%, recanalisation rate 8.8% and 5-year-reintervention rate 58.8%. Chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found in 79.4%, Staphylococcus areus in 50% and Aspergillus fumigatus in 47.1%. DISCUSSION: ssBACE is a safe and effective treatment for massive haemoptysis in patients with CF with good results for controlling haemostasis and excellent short-term and long-term survival, especially in severely affected patients with FEV<40% pred. We think the data of our study support the use of coils and a protocol of careful and prudent embolisation.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'INTRODUCTION: Sepsis and septic shock are the most severe forms of infection affecting predominantly elderly people, preterm and term neonates, and young infants. Even in high-income countries sepsis causes about 8% of admissions to pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Early diagnosis, rapid anti-infective treatment, and prompt hemodynamic stabilization are crucial for patient survival. In this context, it is essential to identify the causative pathogen as soon as possible to optimize antimicrobial treatment. To date, culture-based diagnostic procedures (e.g., blood cultures) represent the standard of care. However, they have 2 major problems: on the one hand, in the case of very small sample volumes (and thus usually in children), they are not sufficiently sensitive. On the other hand, with a time-to-result of 2 to 5 days, blood cultures need a relatively long time for the anti-infective therapy to be calculated. To overcome these problems, culture-independent molecular diagnostic procedures such as unbiased sequence analysis of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from plasma samples of septic patients by next-generation sequencing (NGS) have been tested successfully in adult septic patients. However, these results still need to be transferred to the pediatric setting. METHODS: The Next GeneSiPS-Trial is a prospective, observational, non-interventional, multicenter study used to assess the diagnostic performance of an NGS-based approach for the identification of causative pathogens in (preterm and term) neonates (d1-d28, n = 50), infants (d29 to <1 yr, n = 50), and toddlers (1 yr to <5 yr, n = 50) with suspected or proven severe sepsis or septic shock (according to the pediatric sepsis definition) by the use of the quantitative sepsis indicating quantifier (SIQ) score in comparison to standard of care (culture-based) microbiological diagnostics. Potential changes in anti-infective treatment regimens based on these NGS results will be estimated retrospectively by a panel of 3 independent clinical specialists. DISCUSSION: Neonates, infants, and young children are significantly affected by sepsis. Fast and more sensitive diagnostic approaches are urgently needed. This prospective, observational, non-interventional, multicenter study seeks to evaluate an NGS-based approach in critically ill children suffering from sepsis.

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Vein of Galen malformation (VGM) is a rare congenital intracerebral vascular malformation. The aim of this study was to gain reliable data about epidemiology; clinical manifestations; and pre-, peri- and postinterventional treatment strategies in Germany. METHODS: This prospective epidemiologic study was conducted by Erhebungseinheit fur Seltene Padiatrische Erkrankungen in Deutschland, a hospital-based German nationwide surveillance unit for rare pediatric diseases. Patients aged upto 18 years with a new diagnosis of VGM were prospectively included between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015. RESULTS: In the two-year study period, 30 individuals with newly diagnosed VGM were identified, resulting in an estimated annual incidence rate of VGM in Germany of at least 1: 58,100 live births. The main symptoms were age dependent. Neonates presented with mainly cardiac manifestations of high output failure; infants and older children mainly suffered from neurological complications. Of the patients with endovascular treatment 95% survived, but only 41% of these patients were discharged home without any complications. The Bicetre Neonatal Evaluation Score was a good predictor for poor outcome but could have led to palliative care in some patients with good outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of VGM in Germany is estimated to be 1:58,100 live births. The majority of patients were eligible for endovascular treatment. Nevertheless, due to side effects and long-term sequelae in the majority of patients, further improvement in care of children with VGM is needed.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'Metamizole is a widely prescribed NSAID with excellent analgesic and antipyretic properties. Although very effective, it is banned in some countries because of the risk for severe agranulocytosis. We here describe three patients with metamizole-associated agranulocytosis. Patient #1 suffered from agranulocytosis and tonsillitis followed by severe sepsis by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Epstein-Barr virus reactivation. Her dizygotic twin sister (patient #2) also suffered from agranulocytosis after a surgical intervention. Patient #3 initially had a tonsillitis and also developed neutropenia after metamizole intake. For all patients, pharmacogenetic diagnostic for the genes CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and NAT2, which are involved in metamizole metabolism and degradation of toxic metabolites, was initiated. Pharmacogenetic analysis revealed NAT2 slow acetylator phenotype in all three patients. Additionally, patient #2 is an intermediate metabolizer for CYP2C19 and patient #3 is a poor metabolizer for CYP2C9. Impairment of these enzymes causes a reduced degradation of toxic metabolites, for example, 4-methylaminoantipyrine (4-MAA) or 4-aminoantipyrine. The metabolite 4-MAA can complex with hemin, which is an early breakdown product during hemolysis. Hemolysis is often observed during invasive infections or after surgical procedures. It is known that the 4-MAA/hemin complex can induce cytotoxicity in the bone marrow and interrupt granulocyte maturation. In conclusion, metamizole-induced agranulocytosis most likely was a consequence of the underlying genetical predisposition, that is, polymorphisms in the genes NAT2, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Hemolysis may have increased the toxicity of metamizole metabolites.',\n",

       "               'AB': \"INTRODUCTION: In pediatric patients, flexible bronchoscopy requires deep sedation. Different sedation regimes are common, but only some of them include opioids. Due to their antitussive effect, the use of short-acting opioids may be beneficial for this particular indication, but additional respiratory depression may lead to an increase in adverse events. Here, we systematically compared sedation regimes in children undergoing flexible bronchoscopy with either propofol alone, or a combination of propofol and remifentanil. The primary outcome parameter was the frequency of coughing episodes during the intervention. Secondary outcome parameters were frequency and types of complications, patient satisfaction, examiner satisfaction, and recovery time after finishing the sedation. METHODS: Fifty children aged 1-17 years undergoing flexible bronchoscopy under deep sedation with propofol were randomly assigned to two groups: PR receiving propofol and remifentanil and PP receiving propofol only. Sedation depth was predefined as Comfort Score 10-13. RESULTS: We found significantly less coughing episodes ([med (IQR)] PR: 0.73 (0.28-2.45)/min; PP: 1.98 (1.26-3.12)/min; p = .010) and shorter recovery time in Group PR (PR: 13.5 (8-17.5) min; PP: 21.0 (14-27) min; p = .011). Examiner's satisfaction was higher in Group PR (PR: 10 (8-10); PP: 9 (7-9); p = .012). The number of adverse events, patient satisfaction, and required propofol dose during the intervention did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION: We suggest the combination of propofol with remifentanil instead of using propofol alone in pediatric procedural sedation for flexible bronchoscopy.\",\n",

METHODS: We searched the PubMed database for articles published in English up to September 2020, and 23 papers were identified. RESULTS: aEEG was frequently used to compensate for the absence of continuous full-channel EEG monitoring, particularly for detecting seizures. Interpreting background patterns was based on neonatal classifications, as reference values for older infants and children are lacking. It is possible that aEEG could predict outcomes after paediatric cardiac arrests and other conditions. Gaps in our knowledge exist with regard to normal values in healthy children and the effects of sedation on aEEG background patterns in children. CONCLUSION: The main application of aEEG was detecting and treating paediatric seizures. Further research should determine reference values and investigate the potential to predict outcome after critical events or in acute neurological disease. It is likely that aEEG will play a role in paediatric critical care in the future.',\n",

We tested the hypothesis that antibiotic treatment of preterm infants with aminoglycosides is associated with higher rates of surgical patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure. METHODS: Preterm infants (birthweight <1000 grams or gestational age <29 weeks) enrolled in 62 German neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) were analysed. NICUs were stratified according to the use of aminoglycosides as first-line antibiotics. RESULTS: Baseline data were not different when NICUs using aminoglycosides (n = 9965 infants) were compared to NICUs using other antibiotics (n = 1948 infants). Rates of surgical PDA closure were 5.9% for NICUs using aminoglycosides; 6.2% for units using gentamicin; and 5.0% for NICUs using tobramycin compared to 4.1% in NICUs using other antibiotics (P < .001, P < .001 and P = .140, respectively, Fisher's exact test). Indomethacin and ibuprofen use was more common in NICUs using aminoglycosides (41% vs 33%, P < .001, Fisher's exact test). Gentamicin trough levels were higher in NICUs with surgical closure rates above the mean (median 2.0 microg/mL, inter-quartile range 0.8-4.0 microg/mL vs 1.2 microg/mL, IQR 0.8-1.7, P < .001, Mann-Whitney U test). CONCLUSION: First-line antibiotic treatment of preterm infants with aminoglycosides was associated with higher rates of surgical PDA closure.\",\n",

The objective of this study was to investigate the causes, circumstances, course of disease, and complications of ISH > 300 mg/dl (16.7 mmol/l) in neonates and children. METHODS: We emailed a survey to 105 neonatal and pediatric intensive care units in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, asking to retrospectively report cases of ISH. RESULTS: We received 11 reports about premature infants to children. Four patients (36%) had poor outcome: 2 died and 2 suffered persistent sequelae. The highest observed blood glucose was at median 983 mg/dl (54.6 mmol/l) (range 594-2240 mg/dl; 33.0-124.3 mmol/l) and median time to normoglycemia was 7 h (range 2-23). Blood glucose was higher and time to normoglycemia longer in patients with poor outcome. Invasive therapy was required in 73% (mechanical ventilation) and 50% (vasopressor therapy) of patients, respectively. Administration of insulin did not differ between outcome groups. Patients with poor outcome showed coma (100% vs. 40%) and seizures (75% vs. 29%) more frequently than those with good outcome. CONCLUSIONS: ISH is a severe condition with high morbidity and mortality. Further research to amplify the understanding of this condition is needed, but focus should largely be held on its prevention.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'Background: Hashimoto\\'s thyroiditis is frequently associated with other autoimmune diseases and may include renal involvement. Case description: A 17-year-old female with previously diagnosed Hashimoto\\'s thyroiditis and vitiligo was admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit with hypokalemic paralysis and acidosis, after having suffered from recurrent muscular weakness for approximately one year. A few days later she developed central pontine myelinolysis. After initial stabilization she was also diagnosed with distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) and tubular proteinuria which can occur in Sjogren\\'s syndrome. Extended screening for autoimmune diseases additionally revealed celiac disease. Treatment with Prednisone and substitution of potassium quickly lead to the resolution of proteinuria and dRTA, but unilateral paralysis of the sixth nerve as a result of central pontine myelinolysis was irreversible. Conclusions: This is the rare case of polyautoimmunity including autoimmune thyroiditis, Sjogren\\'s syndrome, vitiligo and celiac disease in an adolescent with few disease-specific symptoms. The diagnoses were made via a complicating nephritis causing dRTA and proteinuria. Delay in diagnosis lead to permanent neurological damage. This case highlights the need for pediatricians to be aware of rare accompanying diseases and their complications in \"common\" pediatric autoimmune diseases like Hashimoto\\'s thyroiditis and celiac disease.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS) is a rare form of alpha-dystroglycanopathy characterized by muscular dystrophy and severe malformations of the CNS and eyes. Bi-allelic pathogenic variants in POMK are the cause of a broad spectrum of alpha-dystroglycanopathies. POMK encodes protein-O-mannose kinase, which is required for proper glycosylation and function of the dystroglycan complex and is crucial for extracellular matrix composition. RESULTS: Here, we report on male monozygotic twins with severe CNS malformations (hydrocephalus, cortical malformation, hypoplastic cerebellum, and most prominently occipital meningocele), eye malformations and highly elevated creatine kinase, indicating the clinical diagnosis of a congenital muscular dystrophy (alpha-dystroglycanopathy). Both twins were found to harbor a homozygous nonsense mutation c.640C>T, p.214* in POMK, confirming the clinical diagnosis and supporting the concept that POMK mutations can be causative of WWS. CONCLUSION: Our combined data suggest a more important role for POMK in the pathogenesis of meningoencephalocele. Only eight different pathogenic POMK variants have been published so far, detected in eight families; only five showed the severe WWS phenotype, suggesting that POMK-associated WWS is an extremely rare disease. We expand the phenotypic and mutational spectrum of POMK-associated WWS and provide evidence of the broad phenotypic variability of POMK-associated disease.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) calculates regional tissue oxygenation (rSO2) using the different absorption spectra of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin molecules. A probe placed on the skin emits light that is absorbed, scattered, and reflected by the underlying tissue. Detectors in the probe sense the amount of reflected light: this reflects the organ-specific ratio of oxygen supply and consumption - independent of pulsatile flow. Modern devices enable the simultaneous monitoring at different body sites. A rise or dip in the rSO2 curve visualizes changes in oxygen supply or demand before vital signs indicate them. The evolution of rSO2 values in relation to the starting point is more important for interpretation than are absolute values. A routine clinical application of NIRS is the surveillance of somatic and cerebral oxygenation during and after cardiac surgery. It is also administered in preterm infants at risk for necrotizing enterocolitis, newborns with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and a potential risk of impaired tissue oxygenation. In the future, NIRS could be increasingly used in multimodal neuromonitoring, or applied to monitor patients with other conditions (e.g., after resuscitation or traumatic brain injury).',\n",

       "               'AB': 'Almost half of all preterm births are caused or triggered by an inflammatory process at the feto-maternal interface resulting in preterm labor or rupture of membranes with or without chorioamnionitis (\"first inflammatory hit\"). Preterm babies have highly vulnerable body surfaces and immature organ systems. They are postnatally confronted with a drastically altered antigen exposure including hospital-specific microbes, artificial devices, drugs, nutritional antigens, and hypoxia or hyperoxia (\"second inflammatory hit\"). This is of particular importance to extremely preterm infants born before 28 weeks, as they have not experienced important \"third-trimester\" adaptation processes to tolerate maternal and self-antigens. Instead of a balanced adaptation to extrauterine life, the delicate co-regulation between immune defense mechanisms and immunosuppression (tolerance) to allow microbiome establishment is therefore often disturbed. Hence, preterm infants are predisposed to sepsis but also to several injurious conditions that can contribute to the onset or perpetuation of sustained inflammation (SI). This is a continuing challenge to clinicians involved in the care of preterm infants, as SI is regarded as a crucial mediator for mortality and the development of morbidities in preterm infants. This review will outline the (i) role of inflammation for short-term consequences of preterm birth and (ii) the effect of SI on organ development and long-term outcome.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: The reason for increased serum creatinine levels in preterm infants often remains unclear. We aimed to determine whether postnatal serum creatinine in preterm infants correlates with intake of amniotic fluid, represented by the amount of amniotic fluid after preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). METHODS: 74 preterm infants with PPROM > 48 h duration were retrospectively studied. Postnatal creatinine concentration was determined at day 2-5, 10-17 and 26-33 of life and compared between infants with normal intrauterine amniotic volumes, oligohydramnios and anhydramnios. RESULTS: Mean gestational age of included patients was 29.7 weeks (range: 24.0-36.1 weeks) and mean birth weight was 1452 g (range: 560-2940 g). Serum creatinine concentration was similar at day 2-5 and day 10-17 of life between the three groups. We observed a significant decrease in creatinine concentration from day 2-5 to day 26-33 in infants with normal amniotic fluid volume and oligohydramnios (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0071, respectively), but not in anhydramnios. On day 26-33 of life, infants with anhydramnios showed significantly higher creatinine levels compared to infants with normal amniotic fluid volume and oligohydramnios (p = 0.0211). CONCLUSION: Postnatal serum creatinine of preterm infants at day 26-33 of life is elevated in infants with PPROM-induced anhydramnios, but not in oligohydramnios.',\n",

Here we report the two-year outcome from the AMV (avoid mechanical ventilation) study, the first randomized controlled trial on this mode of surfactant delivery. No statistically significant differences in weight, length or neurodevelopmental outcome (Bayley II scores) were found between the LISA intervention group (n = 95) and the control group (n = 84) that received standard treatment.Conclusion: No differences in outcome were observed at 2 years. LISA seems safe in that aspect. What is Known: * LISA is a method that is in increasing use for surfactant delivery to spontaneously breathing infants. LISA reduces the need for mechanical ventilation. What is New: * Outcome data at 2 years from the first randomized study with LISA raise no safety concerns in comparison to a group of infants that received standard treatment.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'Gastrointestinal complications during the neonatal period, i.e. necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP), are associated with adverse short-term outcome in very-low-birthweight infants (VLBWI, <1500 g birth weight). However, little is known about the neurological outcome of survivors at school age. We analysed data of 2241 infants followed-up at the age of 6 years. To determine the effect of NEC and SIP on cognitive outcome in consideration of other important confounding factors, we used multivariable logistic regression models. In addition, infants with surgical diagnosis of NEC (n = 43) or SIP (n = 41) were compared to NEC (n = 43) or SIP (n = 41) negative controls using Mahalanobis distance matching. Infants with a history for NEC had a three times increased risk (RR 3.0 [1.8-4.2], p < 0.001) to develop IQ scores <85 while history of surgical SIP did not increase the relative risk for lower IQs at school age (RR 1.0 [0.4-2.1], p = 1.000). In a matched-cohort analysis, we confirmed that infants with surgical NEC had lower mean IQ results than unaffected controls (+/-SD) (85+/-17 vs. 94+/-14, p = 0.023) while no differences were found for history of SIP. Our results reflect that the different aetiology and inflammatory extent of NEC and SIP may lead to disparate neurodevelopment trajectories. Hence, our data suggest a potential role of early gut-brain axis distortion in infants with NEC which needs to be further explored.',\n",

       "               'AB': \"Background: Evidence supporting continuous EEG monitoring in pediatric intensive care is increasing, but continuous full-channel EEG is a scarce resource. Amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) monitors are broadly available in children's hospitals due to their use in neonatology and can easily be applied to older patients. Objective: The aim of this survey was to evaluate the use of amplitude-integrated EEG in German and Swiss pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Design: An online survey was sent to German and Swiss PICUs that were identified via databases provided by the German Pediatric Association (DGKJ) and the Swiss Society of Intensive Care (SGI). The questionnaire contained 18 multiple choice questions including the PICU size and specialization, indications for aEEG use, perceived benefits from aEEG, and data storage. Main results: Forty-three (26%) PICUs filled out the questionnaire. Two thirds of all interviewed PICUs use aEEG in non-neonates. Main indications were neurological complications or disease and altered mental state. Features assessed were mostly seizures and side differences, less frequently height of amplitude and background pattern. Interpretation of raw EEG also played an important role. All interviewees would appreciate the establishment of reference values for toddlers and children. Conclusions: aEEG is used in a large proportion of the interviewed PICUs. The wide-spread use without validation of data generates the need for further evaluation of this technique and the establishment of reference values for non-neonates.\",\n",

       "               'AB': 'The aim of this study was to correlate ventricular size and volumes of deep gray matter (DGM) in MRI at term equivalent age (TEA) with outcome at a corrected age of 24 months in preterm infants and with handedness. Seventy-three infants born before 32 weeks of gestation or with birth weight < 1500 g  were included in this retrospective analysis and measurement of lateral ventricles, and DGM was performed on MRI scans. The left lateral ventricle was significantly larger than the right lateral ventricle (p = 0.001). There was no correlation between volumes of the right and left ventricles and the DGM volume (p = 0.207 and p = 0.597, respectively), nor with the head circumference at TEA (p = 0.177 and p = 0.976, respectively). The total volume of both lateral ventricles did not correlate with Mental Develomental Index (MDI, p = 0.336) or Psychomotor Developmental Index (PDI, p = 0.650) score (Bayley Scales of Infant Development, BSID II). However, a correlation of total DGM volume with birth weight (p = 0.0001; r = 0.437), head circumference at TEA (p < 0.0001; r = 0.640), MDI (p = 0.029; r = 0.310), and PDI (p = 0.002; r = 0.456) was observed. No significant difference between right- and left-handed infants was seen in relation to volumes of both lateral ventricles and of DGM.Conclusion: DGM volume at TEA was significantly associated with the outcome at a corrected age of 24 months. Handedness did not correlate with DGM or lateral ventricle size.What is Known:* White matter injury as well as altered development of deep gray matter is associated with neurodevelopmental disability in preterm infants.* No study analyzed the association between deep gray matter volume or volumes of lateral ventricle and handedness in former preterm infants so far.What is New:* Volume of deep gray matter, but not lateral ventricular size was significantly associated with outcome at a corrected age of 24 months in preterm infants.* There was no correlation of handedness with volumes of lateral ventricular size or with deep gray matter volumes.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Infectious complications after pediatric liver transplantation frequently occur and are potentially serious. Data concerning strictly defined bacterial infections and their associated risk factors are lacking. METHODS: For the pediatric liver transplant postoperative period, we analyzed data from the nosocomial infection surveillance (2006-2015). RESULTS: A total of 235 bacterial infections in 162 transplantations (47%) occurred, including 32 bacterial pneumonia cases, 104 surgical site infections, 27 urinary tract infections, and 40 bloodstream infections. Sepsis was diagnosed in 127 cases (54%), severe sepsis in 22 (9%) cases, and septic shock in 41 (17%) cases. Thirty patients (9%) died, and septic shock was the leading cause of death. The carrier status of multi-drug resistant bacteria and a tacrolimus level >20 ng/mL were independent risk factors for surgical site infections and the occurrence of severe sepsis or septic shock. The length of mechanical ventilation was an independent risk factor for pneumonia and surgical site infection. CONCLUSION: Bacterial infections in the early postoperative period after pediatric liver transplantation are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Physicians involved in the medical care of these patients should be aware of the specific risk factors, and further development of prevention programs is highly recommended.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'Objective: Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is a risk factor for chorioamnionitis (CA) and injury to the fetal brain. However, prolongation of gestation prevents morbidity and decreases complications of prematurity. The current investigation is to define risk factors for the adverse neurological outcome from the influence of PPROM of at least 7 days.Methods: A case-control study included three groups of preterm infants born at the University Hospitals Bonn and Essen, Germany. The first group consisted of infants with PPROM of at least 7 days and no chorioamnionitis (CA) (PPROM group), the second included preterm infants with CA (CA group), and the third group consisted of infants without PPROM and CA (control group). The outcome was assessed using Bayley Scales of Infant Development at a corrected age of 24 months. Each group consisted of 20 corresponding infants with an identical birth weight and gestational age at birth.Results: There was no significant difference between the mental development index (MDI) and psychomotor development index (PDI) scores (mean +/- SD): the MDI score was 101 +/- 14 in the PPROM group, 98 +/- 12 in the CA group and 96 +/- 17 in the control group; the PDI score 96 +/- 10, 89 +/- 16, and 90 +/- 17, respectively. Multiple regression analysis revealed no significant influence of PPROM and CA on neurological outcome.Conclusions: PPROM of at least 7 days has no influence on neurodevelopmental outcome at a corrected age of 24 months when birth is initiated in the case of beginning CA.',\n",

A single-center cohort of 38 infants born before 32 weeks of gestation was subjected to both investigations. Structural measurements were performed on MRI. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify independent factors including functional and structural brain measurements associated with outcome at a corrected age of 24 months. aEEG parameters significantly correlated with MRI measurements. Reduced deep gray matter volume was associated with low Burdjalov Score on day 3 (p < 0.0001) and day 1-3 (p = 0.0012). The biparietal width and the transcerebellar diameter were related to Burdjalov Score on day 1 (p = 0.0111; p = 0.0002). The final multiple regression analysis revealed independent predictors of neurodevelopmental outcome: intraventricular hemorrhage (p = 0.0060) and interhemispheric distance (p = 0.0052) for mental developmental index; Burdjalov Score day 1 (p = 0.0201) and interhemispheric distance (p = 0.0142) for psychomotor developmental index. CONCLUSION: Functional aEEG parameters were associated with altered brain maturation on MRI. The combination of aEEG and MRI contributes to the prediction of outcome at 24 months. What is Known: * Prematurity remains a risk factor for impaired neurodevelopment. * aEEG is used to measure brain activity in preterm infants and cranial MRI is performed to identify structural gray and white matter abnormalities with impact on neurodevelopmental outcome. What is New: * aEEG parameters observed within the first 72 h of life were associated with altered deep gray matter volumes, biparietal width, and transcerebellar diameter at term equivalent age. * The combination of aEEG and MRI contributes to the prediction of neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years of corrected age in very preterm infants.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: The diagnostic proof of fungal infection in preterm infants is difficult. Antifungal treatment (AFT) is often initiated empirically when infants with suspected infection do not improve despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. It was the aim of our study to determine the rate of exposure to empirical AFT in a large cohort of very low birth weight infants (VLBWI) of the German Neonatal Network and to address associated risks and outcomes. METHODS: The epidemiologic database consisted of n = 13,343 VLBWI born in 54 German Neonatal Network centers between 2009 and 2015. AFT was defined as number of neonates who got any dose of at least one of the following antifungal drugs: fluconazole, amphotericin B, voriconazole and caspofungin (denominator: number of infants enrolled in German Neonatal Network) for treatment (not prophylaxis) of (suspected) fungal infection. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for exposure to AFT and associated short-term morbidities and long-term outcomes at 5-year follow-up. RESULTS: In our cohort, 724 out of 13,343 (5.4%) VLBWI were exposed to empiric AFT and had a mean gestational age of 25.7 (+/-2.1) weeks. Forty-four out of 13,343 (0.3%) had proven bloodstream infection with Candida spp. The main risk factors for exposure to AFT were gestational age, postnatal steroid treatment, need for abdominal surgery and use of carbapenems. Notably, AFT was associated with adverse outcomes such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6-2.3; P < 0.001) and retinopathy of prematurity requiring intervention (adjusted OR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.3-2.3; P <0.001) but not mortality. In the subgroup of infants available for 5-year follow-up (n = 895), exposure to AFT was associated with a risk for cerebral palsy (adjusted OR: 2.79; 95% CI: 1.11-7.04; P = 0.04) and intelligence quotient < 85 (adjusted OR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.01-4.28; P = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of VLBWI is exposed to AFT, specifically those born <26 weeks. Exposed infants were found to have a higher risk for adverse outcomes, which may reflect their significant vulnerability in general. Given the observational design of our study, it remains unclear whether potential side effects of empirical or target AFT itself contribute to adverse outcome. Future studies need to include risk-based strategies and stewardship programs to restrict the use of antifungal management in VLBWI.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: There are only few data on medical problems and utilization of health services of former very low birth weight (VLBW) children at preschool age. STUDY DESIGN: At five years of age parents of a cohort of VLBW children (N=862) received questionnaires, a medical interview and examination. The results were compared to the KIGGS cohort (Deutscher-Kinder-und Jugendgesundheitssurvey, N=777). RESULTS: Parents of the VLBW and KIGGS cohort reported a very good or good health in 95% in their children. When compared to the KIGGS cohort, families in the VLBW cohort had a lower social economic status. The VLBW cohort suffered more frequently from disabilities (9.6% vs. 1.4%), from chronic bronchitis (45% vs. 17%) and from recurrent pain (headaches (20% vs. 7%), ear (16% vs. 6%), throat (23% vs. 8%), tooth (10% vs. 3%)). The VLBW cohort received more specialized care (ophthalmologist, ENT, orthopaedics, paediatric neurologist). CONCLUSION: Families of VLBW children report a good health status in their children, but they utilized more specialized care. Higher rates of pain are reported in the VLBW cohort. Chronic bronchitis and various upper respiratory infections cause an increased morbidity in former VLBW children. Follow up programs are needed to develop optimal treatment and prevention strategies for these problems.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'Amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) is an easily accessible technique to monitor the electrocortical activity in preterm and term infants in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). This method was first used to monitor newborns after asphyxia, providing information about future neurological outcomes. The aEEG is also helpful to select newborns who benefit from cooling. The aEEG monitoring of preterm infants is becoming more widespread, as various studies have shown that neurodevelopmental outcome is related to early aEEG tracings. Here, we demonstrate the application of the aEEG monitoring system and present typical patterns that depend upon gestational age and pathophysiological conditions. Furthermore, we mention pitfalls in the interpretation of the aEEG, as this method requires accurate fixation and localization of the electrodes. Additionally, the raw EEG can be used to detect neonatal seizures or to identify aEEG application problems. In conclusion, aEEG is a safe and generally well-tolerated method for the bedside monitoring of neonatal cerebral function; it can even provide information about long-term outcome.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'OBJECTIVES: Studies on the influence of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) deficiency on infection susceptibility in preterm infants have yielded controversial results. We investigated the association of genotype-based MBL levels with outcome in very-low-birth weight infants (VLBWI). METHODS: We genotyped 3 genetic variants of MBL2 (rs1800450, rs1800451, rs5030737) in 6878 VLBWI. MBL plasma levels were categorized as normal (wild type, A/A), low (heterozygotes, A/O) or undetectable (homozygotes, O/O). Primary outcome was the effect of genotype-based MBL2 levels on blood-culture proven and clinical sepsis during primary stay in hospital. We also evaluated burden of infection within 24 months after discharge. RESULTS: We found no association between MBL levels and sepsis risk in the whole cohort. Infants without measurable MBL levels born between 32 0/7 to 36 6/7 weeks of gestation, however, had a higher rate of Gram-negative sepsis than infants with normal or reduced MBL levels. In a follow-up investigation at 24 months (n = 1070 infants), infants without measurable MBL levels suffered more frequently from stomatitis and urinary tract infection. CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort of VLBWI MBL2 deficiency had no major impact on infection risk unless children were born between 32 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Very-low-birth-weight infants (VLBWI) are frequently delivered by cesarean section (CS). However, it is unclear at what gestational age the benefits of spontaneous delivery outweigh the perinatal risks, i.e. intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) or death. OBJECTIVES: To assess the short-term outcome of VLBWI on IVH according to mode of delivery in a population-based cohort of the German Neonatal Network (GNN). STUDY DESIGN: A total cohort of 2203 singleton VLBWI with a birth weight <1500g and gestational age between 22 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks born and discharged between 1st of January 2009 and 31st of December 2015 was available for analysis. VLBWI were stratified into three categories according to mode of delivery: (1) planned cesarean section (n=1381), (2) vaginal delivery (n=632) and (3) emergency cesarean section (n=190). Outcome was assessed in univariate and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Prevalence of IVH was significantly higher in the vaginal delivery (VD) (26.6%) and emergency CS group (31.1%) as compared to planned CS (17.2%), respectively. In a logistic regression analysis including known risk factors for IVH, vaginal delivery (OR 1.725 [1.325-2.202], p</=0.001) and emergency cesarean section (OR 1.916 [1.338-2.746], p</=0.001) were independently associated with IVH risk. In the subgroup of infants >30 weeks of gestation prevalence for IVH was not significantly different in VD and planned CS (5.3% vs. 4.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Our observational data demonstrate that elective cesarean section is associated with a reduced risk of IVH in preterm infants <30 weeks gestational age when presenting with preterm labor.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'Neurodevelopmental outcome after prematurity is crucial. The aim was to compare two amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) classifications (Hellstrom-Westas (HW), Burdjalov) for outcome prediction. We recruited 65 infants </=32 weeks gestational age with aEEG recordings within the first 72 h of life and Bayley testing at 24 months corrected age or death. Statistical analyses were performed for each 24 h section to determine whether very immature/depressed or mature/developed patterns predict survival/neurological outcome and to find predictors for mental development index (MDI) and psychomotor development index (PDI) at 24 months corrected age. On day 2, deceased infants showed no cycling in 80% (HW, p = 0.0140) and 100% (Burdjalov, p = 0.0041). The Burdjalov total score significantly differed between groups on day 2 (p = 0.0284) and the adapted Burdjalov total score on day 2 (p = 0.0183) and day 3 (p = 0.0472). Cycling on day 3 (HW; p = 0.0059) and background on day 3 (HW; p = 0.0212) are independent predictors for MDI (p = 0.0016) whereas no independent predictor for PDI was found (multiple regression analyses). CONCLUSION: Cycling in both classifications is a valuable tool to assess chance of survival. The classification by HW is also associated with long-term mental outcome. What is Known: *Neurodevelopmental outcome after preterm birth remains one of the major concerns in neonatology. *aEEG is used to measure brain activity and brain maturation in preterm infants. What is New: *The two common aEEG classifications and scoring systems described by Hellstrom-Westas and Burdjalov are valuable tools to predict neurodevelopmental outcome when performed within the first 72 h of life. *Both aEEG classifications are useful to predict chance of survival. The classification by Hellstrom-Westas can also predict long-term outcome at corrected age of 2 years.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Induction of lung maturation by prenatal steroid treatment has become the standard of care for pregnant women at risk for preterm birth. In addition to the beneficial effects on lung maturation, prenatal steroids have been shown to reduce the incidence of neonatal death, necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, and intraventricular hemorrhage. However, little is known about the role of interindividual differences in corticoid sensitivity arising from polymorphisms in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of GR polymorphisms N363S (rs56149945), R23K (rs6190), and BclI (rs41423247) on neonatal outcome. METHODS: The GR polymorphisms N363S, R23K, and BclI were examined in 10,490 very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) preterm infants from 49 German tertiary level neonatal units (German Neonatal Network, GNN) with respect to neonatal outcome. RESULTS: Infants carrying the BclI genotype were at higher risk to develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (OR 1.12 per BclI allele, 95% CI: 1.02-1.23, p = 0.013) in a logistic regression model adjusted for gestational age, mechanical ventilation, and small for gestational age status. A similar relative risk was seen in the children (89.4%) who received antenatal betamethasone treatment (OR 1.16, 95% CI: 1.05-1.27, p = 0.003), whereas no such effect was detectable in infants without antenatal steroids. N363S and R23K did not show any stable association with neonatal outcome parameters. CONCLUSION: Except for a slightly higher risk of BPD in carriers of the GRBclI variant, the GR gene polymorphisms BclI, N363S, and R23K did not affect neonatal outcome parameters in this large multicenter cohort of VLBW preterm infants.',\n",

A new assay system, which directly detects sTRAb in sera by applying bridge technology, has been established and is now available as automated chemiluminescence (bridge) immunoassay. We evaluated the automated bridge assay in clinical routine and compared it with a conventional automated TRAb assay (competition assay). Altogether, 226 Graves' disease (GD), 57 autoimmune thyroiditis, 74 non-autoimmune nodular goiter and 49 thyroid cancer patients, as well as 41 healthy controls were retrospectively evaluated. ROC plot analysis based on sera of newly diagnosed GD patients revealed an area under curve of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.99-1.0) indicating a high assay sensitivity and specificity. The highest sensitivity (100%) and specificity (99%) were seen at a cut-off level of 0.55 IU/l. The calculated positive predictive value was 94%, whereas the negative was 100%. Applying a ROC plot-derived cut-off of>/=0.30 IU/l, derived from sera of GD patients already receiving antithyroid drug therapy for</=6 months, the sensitivity was 99% whereas the specificity was 98%. Detailed comparison of both assay systems used revealed a slightly different distribution of sTRAb and TRAb. Measurement of sTRAb during follow-up revealed a steady decline over one year of follow-up. In summary, our results demonstrate that the new automated bridge assay system for detecting sTRAb has a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing GD and to discriminate from other thyroid diseases, respectively. Our study, however, does not provide full evidence that the bridge assay is specific for sTRAb only.\",\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND Between 2010 and 2012, 3 outbreaks of nosocomial infections in German neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) attracted considerable public interest. Headlines on national television channels and in newspapers had important consequences for the involved institutions and a negative impact on the relationship between families and staff in many German NICUs. OBJECTIVE To determine whether NICU outbreaks reported in the media influenced provider behavior in the community of neonatal care and led to more third-line antibiotic prescribing. DESIGN Observational cohort study. METHODS To investigate secular trends, we evaluated data for very-low-birth-weight infants (VLBWIs, birth weight <1,500 g) enrolled in the German Neonatal Network (GNN) between 2009 and 2014 (N=10,253). For outbreak effects, we specifically analyzed data for VLBWIs discharged 6 months before (n=2,428) and 6 months after outbreaks (n=2,508). RESULTS The exposure of all VLBWIs to third-line antibiotics increased after outbreaks (19.4% before vs 22.5% after; P=.007). This trend particularly affected male infants (4.6% increase; P=.005) and infants with a birth weight between 1,000 and 1,499 g (3.5% increase; P=.001) In a logistic regression analysis, month of discharge as linear variable of time was associated with increased exposure to third-line antibiotics (odds ratio [OR], 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.009-1.014; P<.001), and discharge within the 6-month period after outbreak reports independently contributed to this long-term trend (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.017-1.270; P=.024). CONCLUSIONS Media reports directly affect medical practice, eg, overuse of third-line antibiotics. Future communication and management strategies must be based on objective dialogues between the scientific community and investigative journalists.

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: NOD2 loss-of-function mutations, that is, R702W [rs2066844], G908R [rs2066845], and Leu1007fsinsC [rs5743293], have been linked to inflammatory bowel diseases. It is yet unknown whether these variants are also associated with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) or focal intestinal perforation (FIP) in infants of very low birth weight (VLBW). METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we genotyped 9082 VLBW infants with European ancestry enrolled in a prospective, population-based cohort study of the German Neonatal Network. We assessed the effect of the NOD2 gene variants on the risk for major morbidities of the gastrointestinal tract, that is, NEC/FIP requiring surgery in multivariable logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: In the whole cohort of VLBW infants, carriers of >/= 2 NOD2 variant alleles had an increased risk for NEC requiring surgery (odds ratio [OR], 3.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-10.04; P = 0.03) and NEC or FIP requiring surgery (OR, 3.81; 95% CI, 1.70-8.51; P = 0.004) as compared with wild-type genotypes. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis including gestational age, birth weight, gender, multiple birth, and inborn delivery, the association between >/= 2 NOD2 variant alleles and NEC surgery (OR, 4.14; 95% CI, 1.41-12.12; P = 0.009), FIP surgery (OR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.02-12.04; P = 0.047), and NEC or FIP surgery (OR, 4.10; 95% CI, 1.74-9.73; P = 0.001) proved to be independent. We also performed a regression analysis in the subgroup of infants with available information on Lactobacillus acidophilus/Bifidobacterium infantis probiotic supplementation (n = 3638). Although probiotics had a protective effect on NEC and NEC or FIP requiring surgery, the NOD2 variants had no significant impact in this subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: VLBW infants carrying >/= 2 NOD2 genetic risk factors of inflammatory bowel disease in adults have an increased risk for severe gastrointestinal complications, such as NEC requiring surgery. Therefore, infants might benefit from NOD2 genotyping followed by supplementation with probiotics. Replication studies are needed along with genome-wide arrays to allow risk-adapted prevention and therapeutic strategies.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: To assess whether breastmilk feeding is associated with a reduced risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Secondary outcome measures analyzed were retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). STUDY DESIGN: In an ongoing multicenter cohort study, the data of 1433 very low birth weight infants born before 32 weeks of gestation and discharged in 2013 were analyzed. We compared growth and neonatal complications of infants who received breastmilk exclusively (N = 223) with those who received formula feedings exclusively (N = 239). Logistic regression models were estimated for BPD, ROP, and NEC using nutrition as an independent variable. The Firth logistic regression model and Lasso were used for sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Exclusively breastmilk-fed infants gained less weight compared with formula-fed infants. SDS for weight decreased between birth and discharge (median (Q1-Q3): formula -0.9 (-1.4 to [-0.5]) vs breastmilk -1.1 (-1.7 to [-0.6])). Exclusive formula feeding of very low birth weight infants was associated with increased risks of BPD (OR 2.6) as well as NEC (OR 12.6) and ROP (OR 1.80) after controlling for known risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive breastmilk feeding was associated with lower growth rates and a reduced risk of BPD as well as NEC and ROP.',\n",

       "               'AB': \"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate lowest mean arterial blood pressure during the first 24 h of life (minMAP(24)) in very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants and to identify associations between hypotension and short-term outcome. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis of the minMAP(24) of 4907 VLBW infants with a gestational age <32 weeks in correlation with clinical data. Hypotension was defined as minMAP(24) being lower than the median value of all patients of the same gestational age. RESULTS: MinMAP(24) values correlated with gestational age. Median minMAP(24) values of VLBW infants </=29 weeks' gestation were 1-2 mm Hg lower than gestational age in completed weeks. Hypotensive infants had a higher rate of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH, 20.3% vs 15.9%, p<0.001), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD, 19.2% vs 15.1%, p<0.001) and death (5.2% vs 3.0%, p<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analyses, including potential confounders, confirmed these data. MinMAP(24) was an independent risk factor for IVH (OR 0.97/mm Hg, 95% CI 0.96 to 0.99, p=0.003), BPD (OR 0.96/mm Hg, 95% CI 0.94 to 0.98, p<0.001) and mortality (OR 0.94/mm Hg, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.98, p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Hypotension during the first 24 h of life is associated with adverse outcomes in VLBW infants. This underlines the need for randomised controlled trials on the use of vasoactive drugs in this vulnerable patient cohort.\",\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine whether the aEEG at 7 days of life is influenced by the presence of a PDA in non-sedated extremely low gestational age preterm infants. PATIENTS: We prospectively recruited infants born at less than 28 weeks of gestation between 11/2007 and 12/2009. METHOD: aEEGs were recorded at seven days of life and assessed by using the Burdjalov score and the electronically assessed lower border (eLBA). Kruskal-Wallis-Test and linear regression analysis were performed to determine how GA and a PDA affect the aEEG score and the eLBA. Using linear regression analysis we tested which components of the score are affected by a PDA. RESULTS: We recruited 44 infants with a GA of 26.5/7 (23.4/7-27.6/7) weeks and a birth weight of 837 (461-1230) g. The total sum of score points increased from 4 (1-6) to 8 (5-9) points in infants born at 23/24 weeks and 27 weeks of gestation, respectively. In infants with relevant PDA the aEEG scored lower with 8 (3-10) points compared to those with PDA: 5 (1-8) points. Linear regression analysis showed a positive influence of GA and a negative influence of a PDA on the total score. GA had a positive influence on SWC and the visually assessed LBA. A PDA had a negative influence on continuity. The eLBA increased from 4.61 (3.18-5.53) microV to 5.27 (3.38-6.51) microV in infants of 23/24 vs. 27 gestational weeks, but was not significantly influenced by a PDA. CONCLUSION: A PDA has a negative influence on the total Burdjalov score and continuity at 7 days of age in infants born at less than 28 weeks of gestation. The electrocortical disturbances may be the consequence of a diminished cerebral perfusion in the presence of a PDA.',\n",

SUBJECTS/METHODS: Parents of premature infants born in 2009-2011 answered questionnaires regarding introduction of complementary food in the first year of life (N=2262) and were followed up at a post-term age of 2 years (N=981). Length and weight were compared with full-term infants from the KiGGs study. Logistic and linear regression analyses were conducted to study predictors for early introduction of complementary food and the influence of age at introduction of complementary food on later height and weight. RESULTS: Average age at introduction of complementary food was 3.5 months post-term age. The lower the gestational age at birth, the earlier (post-term age) vegetables and meat were introduced. Age at introduction of complementary food was influenced by intrauterine growth restriction, gestational age at birth, maternal education and a developmental delay perceived by the parents. Length and weight at a post-term age of 2 years was not negatively influenced by early introduction of complementary food. CONCLUSIONS: VLBW infants are introduced to complementary food on average before a post-term age of 4 months. There was no negative effect of early introduction of complementary food on height and weight at 2 years of age.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: It was the aim of our study to evaluate the independent effect of preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) as a cause of preterm delivery on mortality during primary hospital stay and significant morbidities in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants < 32 weeks of gestation. DESIGN: Observational, epidemiological study design. SETTING: Population-based cohort, German Neonatal Network (GNN). POPULATION: 6102 VLBW infants were enrolled in GNN from 2009-2012, n=4120 fulfilled criteria for primary analysis (< 32 gestational weeks, no pre-eclampsia, HELLP (highly elevated liver enzymes and low platelets syndrome) or placental abruption as cause of preterm birth). METHODS: Multivariable logistic regression analyses included PPROM as potential risk factors for adverse outcomes and well established items such as gestational age in weeks, birth weight, antenatal steroids, center, inborn delivery, multiple birth, gender and being small-for-gestational-age. RESULTS: PPROM as cause of preterm delivery had no independent effect on the risk of early-onset sepsis, clinical sepsis and blood-culture proven sepsis, while gestational age proved to be the most important contributor to sepsis risk. The diagnosis of PPROM was associated with an increased risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD; OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.02-1.55, p=0.03) but not with other major outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of PPROM per se is not associated with adverse outcome in VLBW infants < 32 weeks apart from a moderately increased risk for BPD. Randomized controlled trials with primary neonatal outcomes are needed to determine which subgroup of VLBW infants benefit from expectant or intentional management of PPROM.',\n",

METHODS: Infants receiving LISA, who were born before 32 gestational weeks and enrolled in the German Neonatal Network, were matched to control infants by gestational age, umbilical cord pH, Apgar-score at 5 min, small for gestational age status, antenatal treatment with steroids, gender and highest supplemental oxygen during the first 12 h of life. Outcome data were compared with chi-square and Mann-Whitney U-tests and adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Between 2009 and 2012, 1103 infants were treated with LISA at 37 centres. LISA infants had lower rates of mechanical ventilation (41% versus 62%, p < 0.001), postnatal dexamethasone treatment (2.5% versus 7%, p < 0.001), BPD (12% versus 18%, p = 0.001) and BPD or death (14% versus 21%, p < 0.001) than the controls. CONCLUSION: Surfactant treatment of spontaneously breathing infants was associated with lower rates of mechanical ventilation and BPD. Additional large-scale randomised controlled trials are needed to assess the possible long-term benefits of LISA.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell anemia and thalassemia result in impaired bone health in both adults and youths. Children with other types of chronic hemolytic anemia may also display impaired bone health. STUDY DESIGN: To assess bone health in pediatric patients with chronic hemolytic anemia, a cross-sectional study was conducted involving 45 patients with different forms of hemolytic anemia (i.e., 17 homozygous sickle cell disease and 14 hereditary spherocytosis patients). Biochemical, radiographic and anamnestic parameters of bone health were assessed. RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency with 25 OH-vitamin D serum levels below 20 ng/ml was a common finding (80.5%) in this cohort. Bone pain was present in 31% of patients. Analysis of RANKL, osteoprotegerin (OPG) and osteocalcin levels indicated an alteration in bone modeling with significantly elevated RANKL/OPG ratios (control: 0.08+0.07; patients: 0.26+0.2, P = 0.0007). Osteocalcin levels were found to be lower in patients compared with healthy controls (68.5+39.0 ng/ml vs. 118.0+36.6 ng/ml, P = 0.0001). Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed a significant (P<0.025) influence of LDH (partial r2 = 0.29), diagnosis of hemolytic anemia (partial r2 = 0.05) and age (partial r2 = 0.03) on osteocalcin levels. Patients with homozygous sickle cell anemia were more frequently and more severely affected by impaired bone health than patients with hereditary spherocytosis. CONCLUSION: Bone health is impaired in pediatric patients with hemolytic anemia. In addition to endocrine alterations, an imbalance in the RANKL/OPG system and low levels of osteocalcin may contribute to this impairment.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: The mitochondrial m.1555A>G mutation is associated with a high rate of permanent hearing loss, if aminoglycosides are given. Preterm infants have an increased risk of permanent hearing loss and are frequently treated with aminoglycoside antibiotics. METHODS: We genotyped preterm infants with a birth weight below 1500 grams who were prospectively enrolled in a large cohort study for the m.1555A>G mutation. Treatment with aminoglycoside antibiotics in combination with mitochondrial m.1555A>G mutation was tested as a predictor for failed hearing screening at discharge in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: 7056 infants were genotyped and analysed. Low birth weight was the most significant predictor of failed hearing screening (p = 7.3 x 10-10). 12 infants (0.2%) had the m.1555A>G-mutation. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, the combination of aminoglycoside treatment with m.1555A>G-carrier status was associated with failed hearing screening (p = 0.0058). However, only 3 out of 10 preterm m.1555A>G-carriers who were exposed to aminoglycosides failed hearing screening. The m.1555A>G-mutation was detected in all mothers of m.1555A>G-positive children, but in none of 2993 maternal DNA-samples of m.1555A>G-negative infants. CONCLUSION: Antenatal screening for the m.1555A>G mutation by maternal genotyping of pregnant women with preterm labour might be a reasonable approach to identify infants who are at increased risk for permanent hearing loss. Additional studies are needed to estimate the relevance of cofactors like aminoglycoside plasma levels and birth weight and the amount of preterm m.1555A>G-carriers with permanent hearing loss.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: To evaluate outcome data in an observational cohort of very low birth weight infants of the German Neonatal Network stratified to prophylactic use of Lactobacillus acidophilus/Bifidobacterium infantis probiotics. STUDY DESIGN: Within the observational period (September 1, 2010, until December 31, 2012, n=5351 infants) study centers were categorized into 3 groups based on their choice of Lactobacillus acidophilus/Bifidobacterium infantis use: (1) no prophylactic use (12 centers); (2 a/b) change of strategy nonuser to user during observational period (13 centers); and (3) use before start of observation (21 centers). Primary outcome data of all eligible infants were determined according to center-specific strategy. RESULTS: The use of probiotics was associated with a reduced risk for necrotizing enterocolitis surgery (group 1 vs group 3: 4.2 vs 2.6%, P=.028; change of strategy: 6.2 vs 4.0%, P<.001), any abdominal surgery, and hospital mortality. Infants treated with probiotics had improved weight gain/day, and probiotics had no effect on the risk of blood-culture confirmed sepsis. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, probiotics were protective for necrotizing enterocolitis surgery (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37-0.91; P=.017), any abdominal surgery (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.51-0.95; P=.02), and the combined outcome abdominal surgery and/or death (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.33-0.56; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our observational data support the use of Lactobacillus acidophilus/Bifidobacterium infantis probiotics to reduce the risk for gastrointestinal morbidity but not sepsis in very low birth weight infants.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: It was the aim of this study to assess whether very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants born small for gestational age (SGA; birth weight less than 10th percentile) are at increased risk for late-onset sepsis. METHODS: This was a prospective, multicenter study of the German Neonatal Network including VLBW infants from 23 to < 32 weeks post menstrual age born 2009-2011. Outcomes were compared between VLBW infants born SGA (birth weight less than tenth percentile according to gestational age and gender) and non-SGA infants. The main outcome measure was at least 1 episode of late-onset sepsis defined as blood-culture-confirmed clinical sepsis occurring at >/= 72 hours of age. RESULTS: 5886 VLBW infants were included. In SGA infants (n = 692), an increased incidence of late-onset sepsis was noted compared with non-SGA infants (20.1% vs. 14.3 %, P < 0.001). This difference was only observed among infants with a gestational age of 27 to < 32 weeks and attributed to sepsis episodes with coagulase-negative staphylococci (12.8% vs. 8.3%, P < 0.001). Different treatment modalities (eg more frequent use of central venous lines) and longer duration of invasive therapies (parenteral nutrition, mechanical ventilation, hospitalization) may account for the increased sepsis risk with coagulase-negative staphylococci in our SGA cohort. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, higher gestational age [per week; odds ratio (OR): 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.72-0.78, P< 0.0001], treatment with antenatal steroids (OR: 0.7, 95% CI: 0.53-0.92, P = 0.01), German descendance (OR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.63-0.91, P = 0.003) and prophylaxis with glycopeptide antibiotics (OR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.47-0.87, P = 0.005) were shown to be protective against late-onset sepsis. In contrast, longer duration of parenteral nutrition (per day; OR: 1.016, 95% CI: 1.011-1.021, P < 0.0001) and SGA were found to be risk factors (OR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.02-1.68, P= 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: SGA contributes to the risk of late-onset sepsis in VLBW infants. Future studies are needed to investigate the underlying pathophysiology to guide individualized preventive measures in this vulnerable subgroup.',\n",

       "               'AB': \"Very low birth weight (VLBW) infants frequently receive analgesia and/or sedation for painful procedures and mechanical ventilation to avoid negative stress. Yet, concerns remain regarding potential adverse long-term effects of these drugs on VLBW infants' neurocognitive outcome. Recent studies have shown that less invasive surfactant application (LISA) and early nasal CPAP treatment reduce the need for mechanical ventilation and painful procedures. Therefore, these measures might also reduce the application of analgesic and/or sedative drugs in VLBW infants. To evaluate this hypothesis and to identify potential changes in analgesic treatment concepts in recent years, we retrospectively analyzed data on analgesia and sedation, respiratory support, and the method of surfactant application in VLBW infants enrolled in the German Neonatal Network (GNN) trial between 2003 and 2009 (period 1) and compared it with data from infants participating in GNN in 2010 (period 2). In both periods, about one third of all infants were treated with analgesic and/or sedative drugs using a wide variety of substances. The administration of novel drugs such as propofol, sufentanil, or intravenous paracetamol was higher in 2010 (6.7 vs. 12.2 %). Infants who were treated with CPAP only received significantly less analgesic/sedative medication than infants who were mechanically ventilated (12 vs. 65 %, p=<0.001). Similarly, infants treated with LISA received less analgesic or sedative drugs as compared to infants who received surfactant via endotracheal intubation (36 vs. 63 %, p=0.001). CONCLUSION: Although both avoidances of mechanical ventilation and less invasive surfactant application are associated with reduced analgesic or sedative treatment, the percentage of VLBW infants who received analgesia and/or sedation remained unchanged in Germany in recent years.\",\n",

We studied the association of common variants with birth weight, gain of body weight, body mass index (BMI), Ponderal index and relevant neonatal outcomes in a large German cohort of infants with a birth weight below 1500 grams. METHODS: The single nucleotide polymorphisms rs9939609 (FTO gene) and rs1424233 (MAF gene) were genotyped using allelic discrimination assays in a prospective multicenter cohort study conducted in 15 neonatal intensive care units in Germany from September 2003 until January 2008. DNA samples were extracted from buccal swabs according to standard protocols. RESULTS: 1946 infants were successfully genotyped at FTO and 2149 infants at MAF. Allele frequencies were not significantly different from other European cohorts. The polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The polymorphisms did not show associations with birth weight, BMI and Ponderal Index at discharge, and weight gain, neither testing for a dominant, additive nor for a recessive model. DISCUSSION: Since an association of the polymorphisms with weight gain has been demonstrated in multiple populations, the lack of association in a population of preterm infants with regular tube feeding after birth and highly controlled feeding volumes provides evidence for the hypothesis that these polymorphisms affect food intake behavior and hunger rather than metabolism and energy consumption.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'PURPOSE: Very premature delivery is a major cause of infant morbidity and mortality. Obesity, diabetes and pregnancy hypertension are known risk factors for pregnancy complications. The study aimed to scrutinize differences of pregnancy complications in a cohort of very premature deliveries compared to a national group. METHODS: In a multicenter study performed between January 2009 and December 2010 including 1,577 very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, we compared parental reported pregnancy problems of VLBW infants with a national cohort (KIGGS). We compared reported pregnancy complications to reasons for premature delivery and neonatal outcome within the group of VLBW infants. RESULTS: While parents of the national cohort reported pregnancy-induced hypertension in 8 %, parents of VLBW infants reported this complication more frequently (27 %). Mothers of the national cohort were significantly younger (1 year), suffered less from obesity, anaemia, diabetes. Regression analysis showed that hypertension (OR = 5.11) and advanced maternal age (OR = 1.03) increased the risk for premature birth. Women with hypertension were likely to experience a clinically indicated premature delivery, had more VLBW infants with a moderate growth restriction, but less multiples and their infants had less intraventricular haemorrhages grade 3 or 4. Otherwise, neonatal outcome was correlated with gestational age but not with the pregnancy complications diabetes, hypertension or obesity. CONCLUSION: Premature birth seems to be correlated to gestational hypertension and associated problems in about (1/4) of VLBW infants. Further studies should focus on preventing and treating gestational hypertension to avoid premature delivery and associated neonatal morbidity.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Morbidity and mortality in Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) infants during their hospital stay have been well described. However, there are insufficient data regarding health problems after discharge. STUDY DESIGN: In a multicenter study performed between January 2009 and December 2010 including 2493 VLBW infants, questionnaires were sent out to all participating parents in the first year of life. We compared the parental reported health of VLBW infants with a national cohort (KIGGS). RESULTS: The reported health of VLBW infants born after 29 weeks of gestation was identical to term infants. Even in the group of infants born before 24 weeks of gestation health was regarded as very good or good in >70% of cases. However, parents described a delayed development in >50% increasing to >70% with lower gestational age. In the first year of life VLBW infants have an increased risk of visual and hearing problems. Bronchitis was more frequent in VLBW infants but there were no differences in other infections typical for that age group. VLBW infants had less sleeping problems. No gender differences were described. CONCLUSION: VLBW infants in our study require slightly more medical care compared to their peers. However, medical problems are relatively small compared to the developmental needs as perceived by their parents. Therefore, close follow-up and advice by specialists in infant development are needed.',\n",

Assessment of zygosity is often based on clinical criteria (evaluation of placenta; same gender, birth weight discordance as surrogate criteria for monochorionic/monozygotic twins). The aim of this study was to compare clinical versus genetic assessment of zygosity and to compare causes of preterm delivery as well as outcome data of very-low-birth-weight (VLBW; birth weight <1,500 g) twins stratified to zygosity. In a multicenter study, we selected n=176 sets of same gender twins and determined zygosity genetically. In a subgroup of 123 sets of twins, the attending physicians at the study centers were asked to document the parameter 'zygosity' (monozygotic/dizygotic) on the basis of their clinical judgment. Concordance between genetic and clinical assessment was 62.7% for monozygotic twins and 88.9% for dizygotic twins, respectively. Outcome parameters (death, BPD, ROP, NEC, IVH) were comparable in both groups. Genetically dizygotic twins were significantly more often born due to intrauterine infection (33% vs. 20% in monozygotic twins, p<.01) and antenatal antibiotics were more frequently given to mothers of dizygotic twins (62% vs. 47% in monozygotic twins, p<.01). Obstetric complications such as twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome were only seen in monozygotic twins as expected. The unexpected increase of antenatal antibiotic treatment and birth due to intrauterine infection in dizygotic twins should be confirmed in additional VLBW twin-cohorts.\",\n",

       "               'AB': \"INTRODUCTION: We evaluated blood culture-proven sepsis episodes occurring in microclusters in very-low-birth-weight infants born in the German Neonatal Network (GNN) during 2009-2010. METHODS: Thirty-seven centers participated in GNN; 23 centers enrolled >/=50 VLBW infants in the study period. Data quality was approved by on-site monitoring. Microclusters of sepsis were defined as occurrence of at least two blood-culture proven sepsis events in different patients of one center within 3 months with the same bacterial species. For microcluster analysis, we selected sepsis episodes with typically cross-transmitted bacteria of high clinical significance including gram-negative rods and Enterococcus spp. RESULTS: In our cohort, 12/2110 (0.6%) infants were documented with an early-onset sepsis and 235 late-onset sepsis episodes (>/=72 h of age) occurred in 203/2110 (9.6%) VLBW infants. In 182/235 (77.4%) late-onset sepsis episodes gram-positive bacteria were documented, while coagulase negative staphylococci were found to be the most predominant pathogens (48.5%, 95%CI: 42.01-55.01). Candida spp. and gram-negative bacilli caused 10/235 (4.3%, 95%CI: 1.68% -6.83%) and 43/235 (18.5%) late-onset sepsis episodes, respectively. Eleven microclusters of blood-culture proven sepsis were detected in 7 hospitals involving a total 26 infants. 16/26 cluster patients suffered from Klebsiella spp. sepsis. The median time interval between the first patient's Klebsiella spp. sepsis and cluster cases was 14.1 days (interquartile range: 1-27 days). First patients in the cluster, their linked cases and sporadic sepsis events did not show significant differences in short term outcome parameters. DISCUSSION: Microclusters of infection are an important phenomenon for late-onset sepsis. Most gram-negative cluster infections occur within 30 days after the first patient was diagnosed and Klebsiella spp. play a major role. It is essential to monitor epidemic microclusters of sepsis in surveillance networks to adapt clinical practice, inform policy and further improve quality of care.\",\n",

       "               'AB': 'AIM: ATP-binding cassette member A 3 (ABCA3) plays a critical role for the transport of surfactant phospholipids into the lamellar bodies of type II alveolar epithelial cells. Term infants carrying the E292V missense mutation of the gene encoding ABCA3 are likely to develop respiratory distress syndrome, and the mutation has also been linked to interstitial lung disease in paediatric patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the E292V genotype with pulmonary morbidity in a large cohort of very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants. METHODS: We performed a genetic association study with a prospective, population-based multi-centre cohort of 3177 VLBW infants born in 16 German study centres between 2003 and 2009 (German Neonatal Network). The ABCA3 genotype was determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism-PCR in genomic DNA samples derived from buccal swabs. RESULTS: In a large cohort of 3177 VLBW infants, 11 individuals were found to be heterozygote for the E292V mutation (0.34%). After stratification according to ABCA3 genotype, no differences were noted for clinical characteristics, necessary treatments and neonatal pulmonary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Within the size limits of our study cohort, the ABCA3 missense mutation E292V had no remarkable effect on pulmonary outcome in VLBW infants. Present results do not rule out the possibility that E292V phenotype is associated with minor difference in the morbidity.',\n",

       "               'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Surfactant is usually given to mechanically ventilated preterm infants via an endotracheal tube to treat respiratory distress syndrome. We tested a new method of surfactant application to spontaneously breathing preterm infants to avoid mechanical ventilation. METHOD: In a parallel-group, randomised controlled trial, 220 preterm infants with a gestational age between 26 and 28 weeks and a birthweight less than 1.5 kg were enrolled in 12 German neonatal intensive care units. Infants were independently randomised in a 1:1 ratio with variable block sizes, to standard treatment or intervention, and randomisation was stratified according to centre and multiple birth status. Masking was not possible. Infants were stabilised with continuous positive airway pressure and received rescue intubation if necessary. In the intervention group, infants received surfactant treatment during spontaneous breathing via a thin catheter inserted into the trachea by laryngoscopy if they needed a fraction of inspired oxygen more than 0.30. The primary endpoint was need for any mechanical ventilation, or being not ventilated but having a partial pressure of carbon dioxide more than 65 mm Hg (8.6 kPa) or a fraction of inspired oxygen more than 0.60, or both, for more than 2 h between 25 h and 72 h of age. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN05025922. FINDINGS: 108 infants were assigned to the intervention group and 112 infants to the standard treatment group. All infants were analysed. On day 2 or 3 after birth, 30 (28%) infants in the intervention group were mechanically ventilated versus 51 (46%) in the standard treatment group (number needed to treat 6, 95% CI 3-20, absolute risk reduction 0.18, 95% CI 0.30-0.05, p=0.008). 36 (33%) infants in the intervention group were mechanically ventilated during their stay in the hospital compared with 82 (73%) in the standard treatment group (number needed to treat: 3, 95% CI 2-4, p<0.0001). The intervention group had significantly fewer median days on mechanical ventilation, (0 days. IQR 0-3 vs 2 days, 0-5) and a lower need for oxygen therapy at 28 days (30 infants [30%] vs 49 infants [45%], p=0.032) compared with the standard treatment group. We recorded no differences between groups for mortality (seven deaths in the intervention group vs five in the standard treatment group) and serious adverse events (21 vs 28). INTERPRETATION: The application of surfactant via a thin catheter to spontaneously breathing preterm infants receiving continuous positive airway pressure reduces the need for mechanical ventilation.

DESIGN: Genetic association studies. SETTING: Prospective, population-based, multicentered cohort of 1944 very-low-birth-weight infants born in 14 German study centers between 2003 and 2008 and 976 mothers, and a second prospective cohort of 926 very-low-birth-weight infants born in 2009 (German Neonatal Network). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In cohort I, 344 of 1944 (18.2%) very-low-birth-weight infants had at least one episode of blood culture-proven sepsis develop. The sepsis incidence stratified to genotype was 19.3% for G/G, 15.8% for G/A, 10.0% for A/A genotype (Cochrane-Armitage trend test: G/G vs. G/A: odds ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.71; G/G vs. A/A: odds ratio, 1.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.91; p = .03). There was a trend for association of tumor necrosis factor-alpha -308 A/G genotype with late-onset sepsis episodes (incidence: 17.2% for G/G, 12.5% for G/A, 10.0% for A/A genotype; Cochrane-Armitage trend test: G/G vs. G/A: odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.9; G/G vs. A/A: odds ratio, 2.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-3.56; p = .009). However, after adjustment for multiple testing, no significant associations were found. Furthermore, the genotype of the investigated 976 mothers had no impact on sepsis risk for their very-low-birth-weight infants. We additionally studied a second prospective cohort of 926 very-low-birth-weight infants and found no associations with sepsis risk. CONCLUSIONS: No association was found between the tumor necrosis factor-alpha -308 G/A polymorphism blood culture-proven sepsis in two large cohorts of very-low-birth-weight infants. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that the tumor necrosis factor-alpha -308 A allele is associated with higher sepsis risk in adult cohorts. Thus, potential differences between adults and infants need to be incorporated in future study designs evaluating risk profiles for sepsis.',\n",
