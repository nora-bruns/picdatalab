### We are proud co-founders and participants of the PIA Network!

## Background
The Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Admissions (PIA) Network was established as a nationwide database in Germany to gather epidemiological, clinical, and outcome data on pediatric critical illness. Until the foundation of PIA in 2022, Germany had no recording system for pediatric intensive care admissions, hindering epidemiological and outcome assessments. 

## Aims
The PIA network intends to address these gaps by providing a framework for clinical and epidemiological research in pediatric intensive care. It collects data on diagnoses, treatment, clinical course, and short-term outcomes and aims to identify areas for improvement in care, enable disease surveillance, and one day serve as a tool for quality control. 

## Method 
The PIA network builds upon the infrastructure of the German Pediatric Surveillance Unit ESPED for data collection. Anonymous data is entered into a central online database by local PIA investigators. 

## Data access
Data access is open to all participating PICUs of the PIA Network via proposals submitted to the steering committee.
