# Quantitative EEG

Our research focuses on using quantitative EEG analysis to detect neurological abnormalities and predict outcomes in critically ill children.

## Project Goals

- Develop advanced algorithms for detecting subtle EEG changes
- Create prediction models for neurological outcomes after critical illness
- Establish best practices for EEG monitoring in pediatric intensive care
- Translate research findings into clinical applications

## Key Accomplishments

- Implemented continuous EEG monitoring protocols
- Published findings on correlation between EEG patterns and outcomes
- Developed a database of pediatric EEG recordings for research
- Collaborated with multiple centers to validate findings

## Team Members

- Dr. Nora Bruns
- Dr. Christian Dohna-Schwake
- Additional team members and collaborators
